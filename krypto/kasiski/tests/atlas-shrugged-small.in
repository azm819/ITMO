CHAPTER I 
THE THEME 



"Who is John Gait?" 

The light was ebbing, and Eddie Willers could not distinguish the bum's 
face. The bum had said it simply, without expression. But from the sunset far 
at the end of the street, yellow glints caught his eyes, and the eyes looked 
straight at Eddie Willers, mocking and still— as if the question had been 
addressed to the causeless uneasiness within him. 

"Why did you say that?" asked Eddie Willers, his voice tense. 

The bum leaned against the side of the doorway; a wedge of broken glass 
behind him reflected the metal yellow of the sky. 

"Why does it bother you?" he asked. 

"It doesn't," snapped Eddie Willers. 

He reached hastily into his pocket. The bum had stopped him and asked for 
a dime, then had gone on talking, as if to kill that moment and postpone the 
problem of the next. Pleas for dimes were so frequent in the streets these 
days that it was not necessary to listen to explanations, and he had no 
desire to hear the details of this bum's particular despair. 

"Go get your cup of coffee, " he said, handing the dime to the shadow that 
had no face. 

"Thank you, sir, " said the voice, without interest, and the face leaned 
forward for a moment. The face was wind-browned, cut by lines of weariness 
and cynical resignation; the eyes were intelligent. Eddie Willers walked on, 
wondering why he always felt it at this time of day, this sense of dread 
without reason. No, he thought, not dread, there's nothing to fear: just an 
immense, diffused apprehension, with no source or object. He had become 
accustomed to the feeling, but he could find no explanation for it; yet the 
bum had spoken as if he knew that Eddie felt it, as if he thought that one 
should feel it, and more: as if he knew the reason. 

Eddie Willers pulled his shoulders straight, in conscientious self- 
discipline. He had to stop this, he thought; he was beginning to imagine 
things. Had he always felt it? He was thirty-two years old. He tried to think 
back. No, he hadn't; but he could not remember when it had started. The 
feeling came to him Suddenly, at random intervals, and now it was coming more 
often than ever. It's the twilight, he thought; I hate the twilight. 

The clouds and the shafts of skyscrapers against them were turning brown, 
like an old painting in oil, the color of a fading masterpiece. Long streaks 
of grime ran from under the pinnacles down the slender, soot-eaten walls. 
High on the side of a tower there was a crack in the shape of a motionless 
lightning, the length of ten stories. A jagged object cut the sky above the 
roofs; it was half a spire, still holding the glow of the sunset; the gold 
leaf had long since peeled off the other half. The glow was red and still, 
like the reflection of a fire: not an active fire, but a dying one which it 
is too late to stop. 

No, thought Eddie Willers, there was nothing disturbing in the sight of 
the city. It looked as it had always looked. 

He walked on, reminding himself that he was late in returning to the 
office. He did not like the task which he had to perform on his return, but 
it had to be done. So he did not attempt to delay it, but made himself walk 
faster . 

He turned a corner. In the narrow space between the dark silhouettes of 
two buildings, as in the crack of a door, he saw the page of a gigantic 
calendar suspended in the sky. 

It was the calendar that the mayor of New York had erected last year on 
the top of a building, so that citizens might tell the day of the month as 
they told the hours of the day, by glancing up at a public tower. A white 



rectangle hung over the city, imparting the date to the men in the streets 
below. In the rusty light of this evening's sunset, the rectangle said: 
September 2 . 

Eddie Willers looked away. He had never liked the sight of that calendar. 
It disturbed him, in a manner he could not explain or define. The feeling 
seemed to blend with his sense of uneasiness; it had the same quality. 

He thought suddenly that there was some phrase, a kind of quotation, that 
expressed what the calendar seemed to suggest. But he could not recall it. He 
walked, groping for a sentence that hung in his mind as an empty shape. He 
could neither fill it nor dismiss it. He glanced back. The white rectangle 
stood above the roofs, saying in immovable finality: September 2. 

Eddie Willers shifted his glance down to the street, to a vegetable 
pushcart at the stoop of a brownstone house. He saw a pile of bright gold 
carrots and the fresh green of onions. He saw a clean white curtain blowing 
at an open window. He saw a bus turning a corner, expertly steered. He 
wondered why he felt reassured— and then, why he felt the sudden, inexplicable 
wish that these things were not left in the open, unprotected against the 
empty space above. 

When he came to Fifth Avenue, he kept his eyes on the windows of the 
stores he passed. There was nothing he needed or wished to buy; but he liked 
to see the display of good?, any goods, objects made by men, to be used by 
men. He enjoyed the sight of a prosperous street; not more than every fourth 
one of the stores was out of business, its windows dark and empty. 

He did not know why he suddenly thought of the oak tree. Nothing had 
recalled it. But he thought of it and of his childhood summers on the Taggart 
estate. He had spent most of his childhood with the Taggart children, and now 
he worked for them, as his father and grandfather had worked for their father 
and grandfather. 

The great oak tree had stood on a hill over the Hudson, in a lonely spot 
of the Taggart estate. Eddie Willers, aged seven, liked to come and look at 
that tree. It had stood there for hundreds of years, and he thought it would 
always stand there. Its roots clutched the hill like a fist with fingers sunk 
into the soil, and he thought that if a giant were to seize it by the top, he 
would not be able to uproot it, but would swing the hill and the whole of the 
earth with it, like a ball at the end of a string. He felt safe in the oak 
tree's presence; it was a thing that nothing could change or threaten; it was 
his greatest symbol of strength. 

One night, lightning struck the oak tree. Eddie saw it the next morning. 
It lay broken in half, and he looked into its trunk as into the mouth of a 
black tunnel. The trunk was only an empty shell; its heart had rotted away 
long ago; there was nothing inside— just a thin gray dust that was being 
dispersed by the whim of the faintest wind. The living power had gone, and 
the shape it left had not been able to stand without it. 

Years later, he heard it said that children should be protected from 
shock, from their first knowledge of death, pain or fear. But these had never 
scarred him; his shock came when he stood very quietly, looking into the 
black hole of the trunk. It was an immense betrayal— the more terrible because 
he could not grasp what it was that had been betrayed. It was not himself, he 
knew, nor his trust; it was something else. He stood there for a while, 
making no sound, then he walked back to the house. He never spoke about it to 
anyone, then or since. 

Eddie Willers shook his head, as the screech of a -rusty mechanism 
changing a traffic light stopped him on the edge of a curb. He felt anger at 
himself. There was no reason that he had to remember the oak tree tonight. It 
meant nothing to him any longer, only a faint tinge of sadness— and somewhere 
within him, a drop of pain moving briefly and vanishing, like a raindrop on 
the glass of a window, its course in the shape of a question mark. 



He wanted no sadness attached to his childhood; he loved its memories: any 
day of it he remembered now seemed flooded by a still, brilliant sunlight. It 
seemed to him as if a few rays from it reached into his present: not rays, 
more like pinpoint spotlights that gave an occasional moment's glitter to his 
job, to his lonely apartment, to the quiet, scrupulous progression of his 
existence . 

He thought of a summer day when he was ten years old. That day, in a 
clearing of the woods, the one precious companion of his childhood told him 
what they would do when they grew up. The words were harsh and glowing, like 
the sunlight. He listened in admiration and in wonder. When he was asked what 
he would want to do, he answered at once, "Whatever is right, " and added, 
"You ought to do something great ... I mean, the two of us together." 
"What?" she asked. He said, "I don't know. That's what we ought to find out. 
Not just what you said. Not just business and earning a living. Things like 
winning battles, or saving people out of fires, or climbing mountains." "What 
for?" she asked. He said, "The minister said last Sunday that we must always 
reach for the best within us. What do you suppose is the best within us?" "I 
don't know." "We'll have to find out." She did not answer; she was looking 
away, up the railroad track. 

Eddie Willers smiled. He had said, "Whatever is right," twenty-two years 
ago. He had kept that statement unchallenged ever since; the other questions 
had faded in his mind; he had been too busy to ask them. But he still thought 
it self-evident that one had to do what was right; he had never learned how 
people could want to do otherwise; he had learned only that they did. It 
still seemed simple and incomprehensible to him: simple that things should be 
right, and incomprehensible that they weren't. He knew that they weren't. He 
thought of that, as he turned a corner and came to the great building of 
Taggart Transcontinental. 

The building stood over the street as its tallest and proudest structure. 
Eddie Willers always smiled at his first sight of it. Its long bands of 
windows were unbroken, in contrast to those of its neighbors. Its rising 
lines cut the sky, with no crumbling corners or worn edges. It seemed to 
stand above the years, untouched. It would always stand there, thought Eddie 
Willers . 

Whenever he entered the Taggart Building, he felt relief and a sense of 
security. This was a place of competence and power. The floors of its 
hallways were mirrors made of marble. The frosted rectangles of its electric 
fixtures were chips of solid light. Behind sheets of glass, rows of girls sat 
at typewriters, the clicking of their keys like the sound of speeding train 
wheels. And like an answering echo, a faint shudder went through the walls at 
times, rising from under the building, from the tunnels of the great terminal 
where trains started out to cross a continent and stopped after crossing it 
again, as they had started and stopped for generation after generation. 
Taggart Transcontinental, thought Eddie Willers, From Ocean to Ocean— the 
proud slogan of his childhood, so much more shining and holy than any 
commandment of the Bible. From Ocean to Ocean, forever— thought Eddie Willers, 
in the manner of a rededication, as he walked through the spotless halls into 
the heart of the building, into the office of James Taggart, President of 
Taggart Transcontinental. 

James Taggart sat at his desk. He looked like a man approaching fifty, who 
had crossed into age from adolescence, without the intermediate stage of 
youth. He had a small, petulant mouth, and thin hair clinging to a bald 
forehead. His posture had a limp, decentralized sloppiness, as if in defiance 
of his tall, slender body, a body with an elegance of line intended for the 
confident poise of an aristocrat, but transformed into the gawkiness of a 
lout. The flesh of his face was pale and soft. His eyes were pale and veiled, 
with a glance that moved slowly, never quite stopping, gliding off and past 



things in eternal resentment of their existence. He looked obstinate and 
drained. He was thirty-nine years old. 

He lifted his head with irritation, at the sound of the opening door. 

"Don't bother me, don't bother me, don't bother me," said James Taggart. 

Eddie Willers walked toward the-desk. 

"It's important, Jim," he said, not raising his voice. 
"All right, all right, what is it?" 

Eddie Willers looked at a map on the wall of the office. The map's colors 
had faded under the glass— he wondered dimly how many Taggart presidents had 
sat before it and for how many years. The Taggart Transcontinental Railroad, 
the network of red lines slashing the faded body of the country from New York 
to San Francisco, looked like a system of blood vessels. It looked as if 
once, long ago, the blood had shot down the main artery and, under the 
pressure of its own overabundance, had branched out at random points, running 
all over the country. One red streak twisted its way from Cheyenne, Wyoming, 
down to El Paso, Texas— the Rio Norte Line of Taggart Transcontinental. New 
tracing had been added recently and the red streak had been extended south 
beyond El Paso— but Eddie Willers turned away hastily when his eyes reached 
that point. 

He looked at James Taggart and said, "It's the Rio Norte Line." He noticed 
Taggart ' s glance moving down to a corner of the desk. "We've had another 
wreck . " 

"Railroad accidents happen every day. Did you have to bother me about 
that?" 

"You know what I'm saying, Jim. The Rio Norte is done for. That track is 
shot. Down the whole line." 

"We are getting a new track." 

Eddie Willers continued as if there had been no answer: "That track is 
shot. It's no use trying to run trains down there. People are giving up 
trying to use them." 

"There is not a railroad in the country, it seems to me, that doesn't have 
a few branches running at a deficit. We're not the only ones. It's a national 
condition— a temporary national condition." 

Eddie stood looking at him silently. What Taggart disliked about Eddie 
Willers was this habit of looking straight into people's eyes. Eddie's eyes 
were blue, wide and questioning; he had blond hair and a square face, 
unremarkable except for that look of scrupulous attentiveness and open, 
puzzled wonder. 

"What do you want?" snapped Taggart. 

"I just came to tell you something you had to know, because somebody had 
to tell you." 

"That we've had another accident?" 

"That we can't give up the Rio Norte Line." 

James Taggart seldom raised his head; when he looked at people, he did so 
by lifting his heavy eyelids and staring upward from under the expanse of his 
bald forehead. 

"Who's thinking of giving up the Rio Norte Line?" he asked. 

"There's never been any question of giving it up. I resent your saying it. 
I resent it very much." 

"But we haven't met a schedule for the last six months. We haven't 
completed a run without some sort of breakdown, major or minor. We're losing 
all our shippers, one after another. How long can we last?" 

"You're a pessimist, Eddie. You lack faith. That's what undermines the 
morale of an organization." 

"You mean that nothing's going to be done about the Rio Norte Line?" 

"I haven't said that at all. Just as soon as we get the new track-" 



"Jim, there isn't going to be any new track." He watched Taggart ' s eyelids 
move up slowly. "I've just come back from the office of Associated Steel. 
I've spoken to Orren Boyle." 

"What did he say?" 

"He spoke for an hour and a half and did not give me a single straight 
answer . " 

"What did you bother him for? I believe the first order of rail wasn't due 
for delivery until next month." 

"And before that, it was due for delivery three months ago." 

"Unforeseen circumstances. Absolutely beyond Orren ' s control." 

"And before that, it was due six months earlier. Jim, we have waited for 
Associated Steel to deliver that rail for thirteen months." 

"What do you want me to do? I can't run Orren Boyle's business." 

"I want you to understand that we can't wait." 

Taggart asked slowly, his voice half-mocking, half-cautious, "What did my 
sister say?" 

"She won't be back until tomorrow." 
"Well, what do you want me to do?" 
"That's for you to decide." 

"Well, whatever else you say, there's one thing you're not going to 
mention next— and that's Rearden Steel." 

Eddie did not answer at once, then said quietly, "All right, Jim. I won't 
mention it." 

"Orren is my friend." He heard no answer. "I resent your attitude. Orren 
Boyle will deliver that rail just as soon as it's humanly possible. So long 
as he can't deliver it, nobody can blame us." 

"Jim! What are you talking about? Don't you understand that the Rio Norte 
Line is breaking up— whether anybody blames us or not?" 

"People would put up with it— they'd have to— if it weren't for the Phoenix- 
Durango." He saw Eddie's face tighten. "Nobody ever complained about the Rio 
Norte Line, until the Phoenix-Durango came on the scene." 

"The Phoenix-Durango is doing a brilliant job." 

"Imagine a thing called the Phoenix-Durango competing with Taggart 
Transcontinental! It was nothing but a local milk line ten years ago." 

"It's got most of the freight traffic of Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado 
now." Taggart did not answer. "Jim, we can't lose Colorado. It's our last 
hope. It's everybody's last hope. If we don't pull ourselves together, we'll 
lose every big shipper in the state to the Phoenix-Durango. We've lost the 
Wyatt oil fields." 

"I don't see why everybody keeps talking about the Wyatt oil fields." 

"Because Ellis Wyatt is a prodigy who—" 

"Damn Ellis Wyatt!" 

Those oil wells, Eddie thought suddenly, didn't they have something in 
common with the blood vessels on the map? Wasn't that the way the red stream 
of Taggart Transcontinental had shot across the country, years ago, a feat 
that seemed incredible now? He thought of the oil wells spouting a black 
stream that ran over a continent almost faster than the trains of the 
Phoenix-Durango could carry it. That oil field had been only a rocky patch in 
the mountains of Colorado, given up as exhausted long ago. Ellis Wyatt ' s 
father had managed to squeeze an obscure living to the end of his days, out 
of the dying oil wells. Now it was as if somebody had given a shot of 
adrenalin to the heart of the mountain, the heart had started pumping, the 
black blood had burst through the rocks— of course it's blood, thought Eddie 
Willers, because blood is supposed to feed, to give life, and that is what 
Wyatt Oil had done. It had shocked empty slopes of ground into sudden 
existence, it had brought new towns, new power plants, new factories to a 
region nobody had ever noticed on any map. New factories, thought Eddie 



Willers, at a time when the freight revenues from all the great old 
industries were dropping slowly year by year; a rich new oil field, at a time 
when the pumps were stopping in one famous field after another; a new 
industrial state where nobody had expected anything but cattle and beets. One 
man had done it, and he had done it in eight years; this, thought Eddie 
Willers, was like the stories he had read in school books and never quite 
believed, the stories of men who had lived in the days of the country's 
youth. He wished he could meet Ellis Wyatt. There was a great deal of talk 
about him, but few had ever met him; he seldom came to New York. They said he 
was thirty-three years old and had a violent temper. He had discovered some 
way to revive exhausted oil wells and he had proceeded to revive them. 

"Ellis Wyatt is a greedy bastard who's after nothing but money," said 
James Taggart. "It seems to me that there are more important things in life 
than making money." 

"What are you talking about, Jim? What has that got to do with—" 
"Besides, he's double-crossed us. We served the Wyatt oil fields for 
years, most adequately. In the days of old man Wyatt, we ran a tank train a 
week . " 

"These are not the days of old man Wyatt, Jim. The Phoenix-Durango runs 
two tank trains a day down there— and it runs them on schedule." 
"If he had given us time to grow along with him—" 
"He has no time to waste." 

"What does he expect? That we drop all our other shippers, sacrifice the 
interests of the whole country and give him all our trains?" 

"Why, no. He doesn't expect anything. He just deals with the Phoenix- 
Durango . " 

"I think he's a destructive, unscrupulous ruffian. I think he's an 
irresponsible upstart who's been grossly overrated." It was astonishing to 
hear a sudden emotion in James Taggart 's lifeless voice. "I'm not so sure 
that his oil fields are such a beneficial achievement. It seems to me that 
he's dislocated the economy of the whole country. Nobody expected Colorado to 
become an industrial state. How can we have any security or plan anything if 
everything changes all the time?" 

"Good God, Jim! He's-" 

"Yes, I know, I know, he's making money. But that is not the standard, it 
seems to me, by which one gauges a man's value to society. And as for his 
oil, he'd come crawling to us. and he'd wait his turn along with all the 
other shippers, and he wouldn't demand more than his fair share of 
transportation— if it weren't for the Phoenix-Durango. We can't help it if 
we're up against destructive competition of that kind. Nobody can blame us." The pressure in his chest and temples, thought Eddie Willers, was the 
strain of the effort he was making; he had decided to make the issue clear 
for once, and the issue was so clear, he thought, that nothing could bar it 
from Taggart ' s understanding, unless it was the failure of his own 
presentation. So he had tried hard, but he was failing, just as he had always 
failed in all of their discussions; no matter what he said, they never seemed 
to be talking about the same subject. 

"Jim, what are you saying? Does it matter that nobody blames us— when the 
road is falling apart?" 

James Taggart smiled; it was a thin smile, amused and cold. "It's 
touching, Eddie," he said. "It's touching— your devotion to Taggart 
Transcontinental. If you don't look out, you'll turn into one of those real 
feudal serfs . " 

"That's what I am, Jim." 

"But may I ask whether it is your job to discuss these matters with me?" 
"No, it isn't." 



"Then why don't you learn that we have departments to take care of things? 
Why don't you report all this to whoever 's concerned? Why don't you cry on my 
dear sister's shoulder?" 

"Look. Jim, I know it's not my place to talk to you. But I can't 
understand what's going on. I don't know what it is that your proper advisers 
tell you, or why they can't make you understand. So I thought I'd try to tell 
you myself . "

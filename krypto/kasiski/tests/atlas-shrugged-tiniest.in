CHAPTER I 
THE THEME 



"Who is John Gait?" 

The light was ebbing, and Eddie Willers could not distinguish the bum's 
face. The bum had said it simply, without expression. But from the sunset far 
at the end of the street, yellow glints caught his eyes, and the eyes looked 
straight at Eddie Willers, mocking and stillâ€” as if the question had been 
addressed to the causeless uneasiness within him. 

"Why did you say that?" asked Eddie Willers, his voice tense. 

The bum leaned against the side of the doorway; a wedge of broken glass 
behind him reflected the metal yellow of the sky. 

"Why does it bother you?" he asked. 

"It doesn't," snapped Eddie Willers. 

He reached hastily into his pocket. The bum had stopped him and asked for 
a dime, then had gone on talking, as if to kill that moment and postpone the 
problem of the next. Pleas for dimes were so frequent in the streets these 
days that it was not necessary to listen to explanations, and he had no 
desire to hear the details of this bum's particular despair. 

"Go get your cup of coffee, " he said, handing the dime to the shadow that 
had no face. 

"Thank you, sir, " said the voice, without interest, and the face leaned 
forward for a moment. The face was wind-browned, cut by lines of weariness 
and cynical resignation; the eyes were intelligent. Eddie Willers walked on, 
wondering why he always felt it at this time of day, this sense of dread 
without reason. No, he thought, not dread, there's nothing to fear: just an 
immense, diffused apprehension, with no source or object. He had become 
accustomed to the feeling, but he could find no explanation for it; yet the 
bum had spoken as if he knew that Eddie felt it, as if he thought that one 
should feel it, and more: as if he knew the reason. 

Eddie Willers pulled his shoulders straight, in conscientious self- 
discipline. He had to stop this, he thought; he was beginning to imagine 
things. Had he always felt it? He was thirty-two years old. He tried to think 
back. No, he hadn't; but he could not remember when it had started. The 
feeling came to him Suddenly, at random intervals, and now it was coming more 
often than ever. It's the twilight, he thought; I hate the twilight. 

The clouds and the shafts of skyscrapers against them were turning brown, 
like an old painting in oil, the color of a fading masterpiece. Long streaks 
of grime ran from under the pinnacles down the slender, soot-eaten walls. 
High on the side of a tower there was a crack in the shape of a motionless 
lightning, the length of ten stories. A jagged object cut the sky above the 
roofs; it was half a spire, still holding the glow of the sunset; the gold 
leaf had long since peeled off the other half. The glow was red and still, 
like the reflection of a fire: not an active fire, but a dying one which it 
is too late to stop. 

No, thought Eddie Willers, there was nothing disturbing in the sight of 
the city. It looked as it had always looked. 

He walked on, reminding himself that he was late in returning to the 
office. He did not like the task which he had to perform on his return, but 
it had to be done. So he did not attempt to delay it, but made himself walk 
faster . 

He turned a corner. In the narrow space between the dark silhouettes of 
two buildings, as in the crack of a door, he saw the page of a gigantic 
calendar suspended in the sky. 

It was the calendar that the mayor of New York had erected last year on 
the top of a building, so that citizens might tell the day of the month as 
they told the hours of the day, by glancing up at a public tower. A white 



rectangle hung over the city, imparting the date to the men in the streets 
below. In the rusty light of this evening's sunset, the rectangle said: 
September 2 .

CHAPTER I 
THE THEME 



"Who is John Gait?" 

The light was ebbing, and Eddie Willers could not distinguish the bum's 
face. The bum had said it simply, without expression. But from the sunset far 
at the end of the street, yellow glints caught his eyes, and the eyes looked 
straight at Eddie Willers, mocking and still— as if the question had been 
addressed to the causeless uneasiness within him. 

"Why did you say that?" asked Eddie Willers, his voice tense. 

The bum leaned against the side of the doorway; a wedge of broken glass 
behind him reflected the metal yellow of the sky. 

"Why does it bother you?" he asked. 

"It doesn't," snapped Eddie Willers. 

He reached hastily into his pocket. The bum had stopped him and asked for 
a dime, then had gone on talking, as if to kill that moment and postpone the 
problem of the next. Pleas for dimes were so frequent in the streets these 
days that it was not necessary to listen to explanations, and he had no 
desire to hear the details of this bum's particular despair. 

"Go get your cup of coffee, " he said, handing the dime to the shadow that 
had no face. 

"Thank you, sir, " said the voice, without interest, and the face leaned 
forward for a moment. The face was wind-browned, cut by lines of weariness 
and cynical resignation; the eyes were intelligent. Eddie Willers walked on, 
wondering why he always felt it at this time of day, this sense of dread 
without reason. No, he thought, not dread, there's nothing to fear: just an 
immense, diffused apprehension, with no source or object. He had become 
accustomed to the feeling, but he could find no explanation for it; yet the 
bum had spoken as if he knew that Eddie felt it, as if he thought that one 
should feel it, and more: as if he knew the reason. 

Eddie Willers pulled his shoulders straight, in conscientious self- 
discipline. He had to stop this, he thought; he was beginning to imagine 
things. Had he always felt it? He was thirty-two years old. He tried to think 
back. No, he hadn't; but he could not remember when it had started. The 
feeling came to him Suddenly, at random intervals, and now it was coming more 
often than ever. It's the twilight, he thought; I hate the twilight. 

The clouds and the shafts of skyscrapers against them were turning brown, 
like an old painting in oil, the color of a fading masterpiece. Long streaks 
of grime ran from under the pinnacles down the slender, soot-eaten walls. 
High on the side of a tower there was a crack in the shape of a motionless 
lightning, the length of ten stories. A jagged object cut the sky above the 
roofs; it was half a spire, still holding the glow of the sunset; the gold 
leaf had long since peeled off the other half. The glow was red and still, 
like the reflection of a fire: not an active fire, but a dying one which it 
is too late to stop. 

No, thought Eddie Willers, there was nothing disturbing in the sight of 
the city. It looked as it had always looked. 

He walked on, reminding himself that he was late in returning to the 
office. He did not like the task which he had to perform on his return, but 
it had to be done. So he did not attempt to delay it, but made himself walk 
faster . 

He turned a corner. In the narrow space between the dark silhouettes of 
two buildings, as in the crack of a door, he saw the page of a gigantic 
calendar suspended in the sky. 

It was the calendar that the mayor of New York had erected last year on 
the top of a building, so that citizens might tell the day of the month as 
they told the hours of the day, by glancing up at a public tower. A white 



rectangle hung over the city, imparting the date to the men in the streets 
below. In the rusty light of this evening's sunset, the rectangle said: 
September 2 . 

Eddie Willers looked away. He had never liked the sight of that calendar. 
It disturbed him, in a manner he could not explain or define. The feeling 
seemed to blend with his sense of uneasiness; it had the same quality. 

He thought suddenly that there was some phrase, a kind of quotation, that 
expressed what the calendar seemed to suggest. But he could not recall it. He 
walked, groping for a sentence that hung in his mind as an empty shape. He 
could neither fill it nor dismiss it. He glanced back. The white rectangle 
stood above the roofs, saying in immovable finality: September 2. 

Eddie Willers shifted his glance down to the street, to a vegetable 
pushcart at the stoop of a brownstone house. He saw a pile of bright gold 
carrots and the fresh green of onions. He saw a clean white curtain blowing 
at an open window. He saw a bus turning a corner, expertly steered. He 
wondered why he felt reassured— and then, why he felt the sudden, inexplicable 
wish that these things were not left in the open, unprotected against the 
empty space above. 

When he came to Fifth Avenue, he kept his eyes on the windows of the 
stores he passed. There was nothing he needed or wished to buy; but he liked 
to see the display of good?, any goods, objects made by men, to be used by 
men. He enjoyed the sight of a prosperous street; not more than every fourth 
one of the stores was out of business, its windows dark and empty. 

He did not know why he suddenly thought of the oak tree. Nothing had 
recalled it. But he thought of it and of his childhood summers on the Taggart 
estate. He had spent most of his childhood with the Taggart children, and now 
he worked for them, as his father and grandfather had worked for their father 
and grandfather. 

The great oak tree had stood on a hill over the Hudson, in a lonely spot 
of the Taggart estate. Eddie Willers, aged seven, liked to come and look at 
that tree. It had stood there for hundreds of years, and he thought it would 
always stand there. Its roots clutched the hill like a fist with fingers sunk 
into the soil, and he thought that if a giant were to seize it by the top, he 
would not be able to uproot it, but would swing the hill and the whole of the 
earth with it, like a ball at the end of a string. He felt safe in the oak 
tree's presence; it was a thing that nothing could change or threaten; it was 
his greatest symbol of strength. 

One night, lightning struck the oak tree. Eddie saw it the next morning. 
It lay broken in half, and he looked into its trunk as into the mouth of a 
black tunnel. The trunk was only an empty shell; its heart had rotted away 
long ago; there was nothing inside— just a thin gray dust that was being 
dispersed by the whim of the faintest wind. The living power had gone, and 
the shape it left had not been able to stand without it. 

Years later, he heard it said that children should be protected from 
shock, from their first knowledge of death, pain or fear. But these had never 
scarred him; his shock came when he stood very quietly, looking into the 
black hole of the trunk. It was an immense betrayal— the more terrible because 
he could not grasp what it was that had been betrayed. It was not himself, he 
knew, nor his trust; it was something else. He stood there for a while, 
making no sound, then he walked back to the house. He never spoke about it to 
anyone, then or since. 

Eddie Willers shook his head, as the screech of a -rusty mechanism 
changing a traffic light stopped him on the edge of a curb. He felt anger at 
himself. There was no reason that he had to remember the oak tree tonight. It 
meant nothing to him any longer, only a faint tinge of sadness— and somewhere 
within him, a drop of pain moving briefly and vanishing, like a raindrop on 
the glass of a window, its course in the shape of a question mark. 



He wanted no sadness attached to his childhood; he loved its memories: any 
day of it he remembered now seemed flooded by a still, brilliant sunlight. It 
seemed to him as if a few rays from it reached into his present: not rays, 
more like pinpoint spotlights that gave an occasional moment's glitter to his 
job, to his lonely apartment, to the quiet, scrupulous progression of his 
existence . 

He thought of a summer day when he was ten years old. That day, in a 
clearing of the woods, the one precious companion of his childhood told him 
what they would do when they grew up. The words were harsh and glowing, like 
the sunlight. He listened in admiration and in wonder. When he was asked what 
he would want to do, he answered at once, "Whatever is right, " and added, 
"You ought to do something great ... I mean, the two of us together." 
"What?" she asked. He said, "I don't know. That's what we ought to find out. 
Not just what you said. Not just business and earning a living. Things like 
winning battles, or saving people out of fires, or climbing mountains." "What 
for?" she asked. He said, "The minister said last Sunday that we must always 
reach for the best within us. What do you suppose is the best within us?" "I 
don't know." "We'll have to find out." She did not answer; she was looking 
away, up the railroad track. 

Eddie Willers smiled. He had said, "Whatever is right," twenty-two years 
ago. He had kept that statement unchallenged ever since; the other questions 
had faded in his mind; he had been too busy to ask them. But he still thought 
it self-evident that one had to do what was right; he had never learned how 
people could want to do otherwise; he had learned only that they did. It 
still seemed simple and incomprehensible to him: simple that things should be 
right, and incomprehensible that they weren't. He knew that they weren't. He 
thought of that, as he turned a corner and came to the great building of 
Taggart Transcontinental. 

The building stood over the street as its tallest and proudest structure. 
Eddie Willers always smiled at his first sight of it. Its long bands of 
windows were unbroken, in contrast to those of its neighbors. Its rising 
lines cut the sky, with no crumbling corners or worn edges. It seemed to 
stand above the years, untouched. It would always stand there, thought Eddie 
Willers . 

Whenever he entered the Taggart Building, he felt relief and a sense of 
security. This was a place of competence and power. The floors of its 
hallways were mirrors made of marble. The frosted rectangles of its electric 
fixtures were chips of solid light. Behind sheets of glass, rows of girls sat 
at typewriters, the clicking of their keys like the sound of speeding train 
wheels. And like an answering echo, a faint shudder went through the walls at 
times, rising from under the building, from the tunnels of the great terminal 
where trains started out to cross a continent and stopped after crossing it 
again, as they had started and stopped for generation after generation. 
Taggart Transcontinental, thought Eddie Willers, From Ocean to Ocean— the 
proud slogan of his childhood, so much more shining and holy than any 
commandment of the Bible. From Ocean to Ocean, forever— thought Eddie Willers, 
in the manner of a rededication, as he walked through the spotless halls into 
the heart of the building, into the office of James Taggart, President of 
Taggart Transcontinental. 

James Taggart sat at his desk. He looked like a man approaching fifty, who 
had crossed into age from adolescence, without the intermediate stage of 
youth. He had a small, petulant mouth, and thin hair clinging to a bald 
forehead. His posture had a limp, decentralized sloppiness, as if in defiance 
of his tall, slender body, a body with an elegance of line intended for the 
confident poise of an aristocrat, but transformed into the gawkiness of a 
lout. The flesh of his face was pale and soft. His eyes were pale and veiled, 
with a glance that moved slowly, never quite stopping, gliding off and past 



things in eternal resentment of their existence. He looked obstinate and 
drained. He was thirty-nine years old. 

He lifted his head with irritation, at the sound of the opening door. 

"Don't bother me, don't bother me, don't bother me," said James Taggart. 

Eddie Willers walked toward the-desk. 

"It's important, Jim," he said, not raising his voice. 
"All right, all right, what is it?" 

Eddie Willers looked at a map on the wall of the office. The map's colors 
had faded under the glass— he wondered dimly how many Taggart presidents had 
sat before it and for how many years. The Taggart Transcontinental Railroad, 
the network of red lines slashing the faded body of the country from New York 
to San Francisco, looked like a system of blood vessels. It looked as if 
once, long ago, the blood had shot down the main artery and, under the 
pressure of its own overabundance, had branched out at random points, running 
all over the country. One red streak twisted its way from Cheyenne, Wyoming, 
down to El Paso, Texas— the Rio Norte Line of Taggart Transcontinental. New 
tracing had been added recently and the red streak had been extended south 
beyond El Paso— but Eddie Willers turned away hastily when his eyes reached 
that point. 

He looked at James Taggart and said, "It's the Rio Norte Line." He noticed 
Taggart ' s glance moving down to a corner of the desk. "We've had another 
wreck . " 

"Railroad accidents happen every day. Did you have to bother me about 
that?" 

"You know what I'm saying, Jim. The Rio Norte is done for. That track is 
shot. Down the whole line." 

"We are getting a new track." 

Eddie Willers continued as if there had been no answer: "That track is 
shot. It's no use trying to run trains down there. People are giving up 
trying to use them." 

"There is not a railroad in the country, it seems to me, that doesn't have 
a few branches running at a deficit. We're not the only ones. It's a national 
condition— a temporary national condition." 

Eddie stood looking at him silently. What Taggart disliked about Eddie 
Willers was this habit of looking straight into people's eyes. Eddie's eyes 
were blue, wide and questioning; he had blond hair and a square face, 
unremarkable except for that look of scrupulous attentiveness and open, 
puzzled wonder. 

"What do you want?" snapped Taggart. 

"I just came to tell you something you had to know, because somebody had 
to tell you." 

"That we've had another accident?" 

"That we can't give up the Rio Norte Line." 

James Taggart seldom raised his head; when he looked at people, he did so 
by lifting his heavy eyelids and staring upward from under the expanse of his 
bald forehead. 

"Who's thinking of giving up the Rio Norte Line?" he asked. 

"There's never been any question of giving it up. I resent your saying it. 
I resent it very much." 

"But we haven't met a schedule for the last six months. We haven't 
completed a run without some sort of breakdown, major or minor. We're losing 
all our shippers, one after another. How long can we last?" 

"You're a pessimist, Eddie. You lack faith. That's what undermines the 
morale of an organization." 

"You mean that nothing's going to be done about the Rio Norte Line?" 

"I haven't said that at all. Just as soon as we get the new track-" 



"Jim, there isn't going to be any new track." He watched Taggart ' s eyelids 
move up slowly. "I've just come back from the office of Associated Steel. 
I've spoken to Orren Boyle." 

"What did he say?" 

"He spoke for an hour and a half and did not give me a single straight 
answer . " 

"What did you bother him for? I believe the first order of rail wasn't due 
for delivery until next month." 

"And before that, it was due for delivery three months ago." 

"Unforeseen circumstances. Absolutely beyond Orren ' s control." 

"And before that, it was due six months earlier. Jim, we have waited for 
Associated Steel to deliver that rail for thirteen months." 

"What do you want me to do? I can't run Orren Boyle's business." 

"I want you to understand that we can't wait." 

Taggart asked slowly, his voice half-mocking, half-cautious, "What did my 
sister say?" 

"She won't be back until tomorrow." 
"Well, what do you want me to do?" 
"That's for you to decide." 

"Well, whatever else you say, there's one thing you're not going to 
mention next— and that's Rearden Steel." 

Eddie did not answer at once, then said quietly, "All right, Jim. I won't 
mention it." 

"Orren is my friend." He heard no answer. "I resent your attitude. Orren 
Boyle will deliver that rail just as soon as it's humanly possible. So long 
as he can't deliver it, nobody can blame us." 

"Jim! What are you talking about? Don't you understand that the Rio Norte 
Line is breaking up— whether anybody blames us or not?" 

"People would put up with it— they'd have to— if it weren't for the Phoenix- 
Durango." He saw Eddie's face tighten. "Nobody ever complained about the Rio 
Norte Line, until the Phoenix-Durango came on the scene." 

"The Phoenix-Durango is doing a brilliant job." 

"Imagine a thing called the Phoenix-Durango competing with Taggart 
Transcontinental! It was nothing but a local milk line ten years ago." 

"It's got most of the freight traffic of Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado 
now." Taggart did not answer. "Jim, we can't lose Colorado. It's our last 
hope. It's everybody's last hope. If we don't pull ourselves together, we'll 
lose every big shipper in the state to the Phoenix-Durango. We've lost the 
Wyatt oil fields." 

"I don't see why everybody keeps talking about the Wyatt oil fields." 

"Because Ellis Wyatt is a prodigy who—" 

"Damn Ellis Wyatt!" 

Those oil wells, Eddie thought suddenly, didn't they have something in 
common with the blood vessels on the map? Wasn't that the way the red stream 
of Taggart Transcontinental had shot across the country, years ago, a feat 
that seemed incredible now? He thought of the oil wells spouting a black 
stream that ran over a continent almost faster than the trains of the 
Phoenix-Durango could carry it. That oil field had been only a rocky patch in 
the mountains of Colorado, given up as exhausted long ago. Ellis Wyatt ' s 
father had managed to squeeze an obscure living to the end of his days, out 
of the dying oil wells. Now it was as if somebody had given a shot of 
adrenalin to the heart of the mountain, the heart had started pumping, the 
black blood had burst through the rocks— of course it's blood, thought Eddie 
Willers, because blood is supposed to feed, to give life, and that is what 
Wyatt Oil had done. It had shocked empty slopes of ground into sudden 
existence, it had brought new towns, new power plants, new factories to a 
region nobody had ever noticed on any map. New factories, thought Eddie 



Willers, at a time when the freight revenues from all the great old 
industries were dropping slowly year by year; a rich new oil field, at a time 
when the pumps were stopping in one famous field after another; a new 
industrial state where nobody had expected anything but cattle and beets. One 
man had done it, and he had done it in eight years; this, thought Eddie 
Willers, was like the stories he had read in school books and never quite 
believed, the stories of men who had lived in the days of the country's 
youth. He wished he could meet Ellis Wyatt. There was a great deal of talk 
about him, but few had ever met him; he seldom came to New York. They said he 
was thirty-three years old and had a violent temper. He had discovered some 
way to revive exhausted oil wells and he had proceeded to revive them. 

"Ellis Wyatt is a greedy bastard who's after nothing but money," said 
James Taggart. "It seems to me that there are more important things in life 
than making money." 

"What are you talking about, Jim? What has that got to do with—" 
"Besides, he's double-crossed us. We served the Wyatt oil fields for 
years, most adequately. In the days of old man Wyatt, we ran a tank train a 
week . " 

"These are not the days of old man Wyatt, Jim. The Phoenix-Durango runs 
two tank trains a day down there— and it runs them on schedule." 
"If he had given us time to grow along with him—" 
"He has no time to waste." 

"What does he expect? That we drop all our other shippers, sacrifice the 
interests of the whole country and give him all our trains?" 

"Why, no. He doesn't expect anything. He just deals with the Phoenix- 
Durango . " 

"I think he's a destructive, unscrupulous ruffian. I think he's an 
irresponsible upstart who's been grossly overrated." It was astonishing to 
hear a sudden emotion in James Taggart 's lifeless voice. "I'm not so sure 
that his oil fields are such a beneficial achievement. It seems to me that 
he's dislocated the economy of the whole country. Nobody expected Colorado to 
become an industrial state. How can we have any security or plan anything if 
everything changes all the time?" 

"Good God, Jim! He's-" 

"Yes, I know, I know, he's making money. But that is not the standard, it 
seems to me, by which one gauges a man's value to society. And as for his 
oil, he'd come crawling to us. and he'd wait his turn along with all the 
other shippers, and he wouldn't demand more than his fair share of 
transportation— if it weren't for the Phoenix-Durango. We can't help it if 
we're up against destructive competition of that kind. Nobody can blame us." 

The pressure in his chest and temples, thought Eddie Willers, was the 
strain of the effort he was making; he had decided to make the issue clear 
for once, and the issue was so clear, he thought, that nothing could bar it 
from Taggart ' s understanding, unless it was the failure of his own 
presentation. So he had tried hard, but he was failing, just as he had always 
failed in all of their discussions; no matter what he said, they never seemed 
to be talking about the same subject. 

"Jim, what are you saying? Does it matter that nobody blames us— when the 
road is falling apart?" 

James Taggart smiled; it was a thin smile, amused and cold. "It's 
touching, Eddie," he said. "It's touching— your devotion to Taggart 
Transcontinental. If you don't look out, you'll turn into one of those real 
feudal serfs . " 

"That's what I am, Jim." 

"But may I ask whether it is your job to discuss these matters with me?" 
"No, it isn't." 



"Then why don't you learn that we have departments to take care of things? 
Why don't you report all this to whoever 's concerned? Why don't you cry on my 
dear sister's shoulder?" 

"Look. Jim, I know it's not my place to talk to you. But I can't 
understand what's going on. I don't know what it is that your proper advisers 
tell you, or why they can't make you understand. So I thought I'd try to tell 
you myself . " 

"I appreciate our childhood friendship, Eddie, but do you think that that 
should entitle you to walk in here unannounced whenever you wish? Considering 
your own rank, shouldn't you remember that I am president of Taggart 
Transcontinental ? " 

This was wasted. Eddie Willers looked at him as usual, not hurt, merely 
puzzled, and asked, "Then you don't intend to do anything about the Rio Norte 
Line? " 

"I haven't said that. I haven't said that at all." Taggart was looking at 
the map, at the red streak south of El Paso. "Just as soon as the San 
Sebastian Mines get going and our Mexican branch begins to pay off—" 

"Don't let's talk about that, Jim." Taggart turned, startled by the 
unprecedented phenomenon of an implacable anger in Eddie's voice. "What's the 
matter?" 

"You know what's the matter. Your sister said—" 
"Damn my sister!" said James Taggart. 

Eddie Willers did not move. He did not answer. He stood looking straight 
ahead. But he did not see James Taggart or anything in the office. 
After a moment, he bowed and walked out. 

In the anteroom, the clerks of James Taggart 's personal staff were 
switching off the lights, getting ready to leave for the day. But Pop Harper, 
chief clerk, still sat at his desk, twisting the levers of a half -dismembered 
typewriter. Everybody in the company had the impression that Pop Harper was 
born in that particular corner at that particular desk and never intended to 
leave it. He had been chief clerk for James Taggart ' s father. 

Pop Harper glanced up at Eddie Willers as he came out of the president's 
office. It was a wise, slow glance; it seemed to say that he knew that 
Eddie's visit to their part of the building meant trouble on the line, knew 
that nothing had come of the visit, and was completely indifferent to the 
knowledge. It was the cynical indifference which Eddie Willers had seen in 
the eyes of the bum on the street corner. 

"Say, Eddie, know where I could get some woolen undershirts?" he asked, 
"Tried all over town, but nobody's got 'em." 

"I don't know," said Eddie, stopping. "Why do you ask me?" 

"I just ask everybody. Maybe somebody' ! ! tell me." 

Eddie looked uneasily at the blank, emaciated face and white hair. 
"It's cold in this joint," said Pop Harper. "It's going to be colder this 
winter . " 

"What are you doing?" Eddie asked, pointing at the pieces of typewriter. 

"The damn thing's busted again. No use sending it out, took them three 
months to fix it the last time. Thought I'd patch it up myself. Not for long, 
I guess." He let his fist drop down on the keys. "You're ready for the junk 
pile, old pal. Your days are numbered." 

Eddie started. That was the sentence he had tried to remember: Your days 
are numbered. But he had forgotten in what connection he had tried to 
remember it. 

"It's no use, Eddie," said Pop Harper. 

"What's no use?" 

"Nothing. Anything." 

"What's the matter, Pop?" 



"I'm not going to requisition a new typewriter. The new ones are made of 
tin. When the old ones go, that will be the end of typewriting. There was an 
accident in the subway this morning, their brakes wouldn't work. You ought to 
go home, Eddie, turn on the radio and listen to a good dance band. Forget it, 
boy. Trouble with you is you never had a hobby. Somebody stole the electric 
light bulbs again, from off the staircase, down where I live. I've got a pain 
in my chest. Couldn't get any cough drops this morning, the drugstore on our 
corner went bankrupt last week. The Texas-Western Railroad went bankrupt last 
month. They closed the Queensborough Bridge yesterday for temporary repairs. 
Oh well, what's the use? Who is John Gait?" 

-k -k -k 

She sat at the window of the train, her head thrown back, one leg 
stretched across to the empty seat before her. The window frame trembled with 
the speed of the motion, the pane hung over empty darkness, and dots of light 
slashed across the glass as luminous streaks, once in a while. 

Her leg, sculptured by the tight sheen of the stocking, its long line 
running straight, over an arched instep, to the tip of a foot in a high- 
heeled pump, had a feminine elegance that seemed out of place in the dusty 
train car and oddly incongruous with the rest of her. She wore a battered 
camel's hair coat that had been expensive, wrapped shapelessly about her 
slender, nervous body. The coat collar was raised to the slanting brim of her 
hat. A sweep of brown hair fell back, almost touching the line of her 
shoulders. Her face was made of angular planes, the shape of her mouth clear- 
cut, a sensual mouth held closed with inflexible precision. She kept her 
hands in the coat pockets, her posture taut, as if she resented immobility, 
and unfeminine, as if she were unconscious of her own body and that it was a 
woman's body. She sat listening to the music. It was a symphony of triumph. 
The notes flowed up, they spoke of rising and they were the rising itself, 
they were the essence and the form of upward motion, they seemed to embody 
every human act and thought that had ascent as its motive. It was a sunburst 
of sound, breaking out of hiding and spreading open. It had the freedom of 
release and the tension of purpose. It swept space clean, and left nothing 
but the joy of an unobstructed effort. Only a faint echo within the sounds 
spoke of that from which the music had escaped, but spoke in laughing 
astonishment at the discovery that there was no ugliness or pain, and there 
never had had to be. It was the song of an immense deliverance. 

She thought: For just a few moments— while this lasts— it is all right to 
surrender completely— to forget everything and just permit yourself to feel. 
She thought: Let go— drop the controls— this is it. 

Somewhere on the edge of her mind, under the music, she heard the sound of 
train wheels. They knocked in an even rhythm, every fourth knock accented, as 
if stressing a conscious purpose. She could relax, because she heard the 
wheels. She listened to the symphony, thinking: This is why the wheels have 
to be kept going, and this is where they're going. 

She had never heard that symphony before, but she knew that it was written 
by Richard Halley. She recognized the violence and the magnificent intensity. 
She recognized the style of the theme; it was a clear, complex melody— at a 
time when no one wrote melody any longer. . . . She sat looking up at the 
ceiling of the car, but she did not see it and she had forgotten where she 
was. She did not know whether she was hearing a full symphony orchestra or 
only the theme; perhaps she was hearing the orchestration in her own mind. 

She thought dimly that there had been premonitory echoes of this theme in 
all of Richard Halley' s work, through all the years of his long struggle, to 
the day, in his middle-age, when fame struck him suddenly and knocked him 
out. This— she thought, listening to the symphony— had been the goal of his 



struggle. She remembered half-hinted attempts in his music, phrases that 
promised it, broken bits of melody that started but never quite reached it; 
when Richard Halley wrote this, he . . . She sat up straight. When did 
Richard Halley write this? 

In the same instant, she realized where she was and wondered for the first 
time where that music came from. 

A few steps away, at the end of the car, a brakeman was adjusting the 
controls of the air-conditioner. He was blond and young. He was whistling the 
theme of the symphony. She realized that he had been whistling it for some 
time and that this was all she had heard. 

She watched him incredulously for a while, before she raised her voice to 
ask, "Tell me please, what are you whistling?" 

The boy turned to her. She met a direct glance and saw an open, eager 
smile, as if he were sharing a confidence with a friend. She liked his face- 
its lines were tight and firm, it did not have that look of loose muscles 
evading the responsibility of a shape, which she had learned to expect in 
people's faces. 

"It's the Halley Concerto," he answered, smiling. 

"Which one?" 

"The Fifth." 

She let a moment pass, before she said slowly and very carefully, "Richard 
Halley wrote only four concertos." 

The boy's smile vanished. It was as if he were jolted back to reality, 
just as she had been a few moments ago. It was as if a shutter were slammed 
down, and what remained was a face without expression, impersonal, 
indifferent and empty. 

"Yes, of course," he said. "I'm wrong. I made a mistake." 

"Then what was it?" 

"Something I heard somewhere." 

"What?" 

"I don't know." 

"Where did you hear it?" 

"I don't remember." 

She paused helplessly; he was turning away from her without further 
interest . 

"It sounded like a Halley theme," she said. "But I know every note he's 
ever written and he never wrote that." 

There was still no expression, only a faint look of attentiveness on the 
boy's face, as he turned back to her and asked, "You like the music of 
Richard Halley?" 

"Yes," she said, "I like it very much." 

He considered her for a moment, as if hesitating, then he turned away. She 
watched the expert efficiency of his movements as he went on working. He 
worked in silence. 

She had not slept for two nights, but she could not permit herself to 
sleep; she had too many problems to consider and not much time: the train was 
due in New York early in the morning. She needed the time, yet she wished the 
train would go faster; but it was the Taggart Comet, the fastest train in the 
country . 

She tried to think; but the music remained on the edge of her mind and she 
kept hearing it, in full chords, like the implacable steps of something that 
could not be stopped. . . . She shook her head angrily, jerked her hat off 
and lighted a cigarette. 

She would not sleep, she thought; she could last until tomorrow night. . . 
. The train wheels clicked in accented rhythm. She was so used to them that 
she did not hear them consciously, but the sound became a sense of peace 
within her. . . . When she extinguished her cigarette, she knew that she 



needed another one, but thought that she would give herself a minute, just a 
few minutes, before she would light it. . . . 

She had fallen asleep and she awakened with a jolt, knowing that something 
was wrong, before she knew what it was: the wheels had stopped. The car stood 
soundless and dim in the blue glow of the night lamps. She glanced at her 
watch: there was no reason for stopping. She looked out the window: the train 
stood still in the middle of empty fields. 

She heard someone moving in a seat across the aisle, and asked, "How long 
have we been standing?" 

A man's voice answered indifferently, "About an hour." The man looked 
after her, sleepily astonished, because she leaped to her feet and rushed to 
the door. There was a cold wind outside, and an empty stretch of land under 
an empty sky. She heard weeds rustling in the darkness. Far ahead, she saw 
the figures of men standing by the engine— and above them, hanging detached in 
the sky, the red light of a signal. 

She walked rapidly toward them, past the motionless line of wheels. No one 
paid attention to her when she approached. The train crew and a few 
passengers stood clustered under the red light. They had stopped talking, 
they seemed to be waiting in placid indifference. 

"What's the matter?" she asked. 

The engineer turned, astonished. Her question had sounded like an order, 
not like the amateur curiosity of a passenger. She stood, hands in pockets, 
coat collar raised, the wind beating her hair in strands across her face. 

"Red light, lady," he said, pointing up with his thumb. 

"How long has it been on?" 

"An hour . " 

"We're off the main track, aren't we?" 

"That's right." 

"Why?" 

"I don't know." 

The conductor spoke up. "I don't think we had any business being sent off 
on a siding, that switch wasn't working right, and this thing's not working 
at all." He jerked his head up at the red light. "I don't think the signal's 
going to change. I think it's busted." 

"Then what are you doing?" 

"Waiting for it to change." 

In her pause of startled anger, the fireman chuckled. "Last week, the 
crack special of the Atlantic Southern got left on a siding for two hours- 
just somebody's mistake." 

"This is the Taggart Comet," she said. "The Comet has never been late." 

"She's the only one in the country that hasn't," said the engineer. 

"There's always a first time," said the fireman. 

"You don't know about railroads, lady," said a passenger. 

"There's not a signal system or a dispatcher in the country that's worth a 
damn . " 

She did not turn or notice him, but spoke to the engineer. 

"If you know that the signal is broken, what do you intend to do?" 

He did not like her tone of authority, and he could not understand why she 
assumed it so naturally. She looked like a young girl; only her mouth and 
eyes showed that she was a woman in her thirties. The dark gray eyes were 
direct and disturbing, as if they cut through things, throwing the 
inconsequential out of the way. The face seemed faintly familiar to him, but 
he could not recall where he had seen it. 

"Lady, I don't intend to stick my neck out," he said. 

"He means," said the fireman, "that our job's to wait for orders." 

"Your job is to run this train." 

"Not against a red light. If the light says stop, we stop." 



"A red light means danger, lady," said the passenger. 

"We're not taking any chances," said the engineer. "Whoever's responsible 
for it, he'll switch the blame to us if we move. So we're not moving till 
somebody tells us to." 

"And if nobody does?" 

"Somebody will turn up sooner or later." 

"How long do you propose to wait?" 

The engineer shrugged. "Who is John Gait?" 

"He means," said the fireman, "don't ask questions nobody can answer." 

She looked at the red light and at the rail that went off into the black, 
untouched distance. 

She said, "Proceed with caution to the next signal. If it's in order, 
proceed to the main track. Then stop at the first open office." 

"Yeah? Who says so?" 

"I do." 

"Who are you?" 

It was only the briefest pause, a moment of astonishment at a question she 
had not expected, but the engineer looked more closely at her face, and in 
time with her answer he gasped, "Good God!" 

She answered, not offensively, merely like a person who does not hear the 
question often: "Dagny Taggart." 

"Well, I'll be—" said the fireman, and then they all remained silent. She 
went on, in the same tone of unstressed authority. "Proceed to the main track 
and hold the train for me at the first open office." 

"Yes, Miss Taggart." 

"You'll have to make up time. You've got the rest of the night to do it. 
Get the Comet in on schedule." 
"Yes, Miss Taggart." 

She was turning to go, when the engineer asked, "If there's any trouble, 
are you taking the responsibility for it, Miss Taggart?" 
"I am." 

The conductor followed her as she walked back to her car. He was saying, 
bewildered, "But . . . just a seat in a day coach, Miss Taggart? But how 
come? But why didn't you let us know?" 

She smiled easily. "Had no time to be formal. Had my own car attached to 
Number 22 out of Chicago, but got off at Cleveland— and Number 22 was running 
late, so I let the car go. The Comet came next and I took it. There was no 
sleeping-car space left." 

The conductor shook his head. "Your brother— he wouldn't have taken a 
coach . " 

She laughed. "No, he wouldn't have." 

The men by the engine watched her walking away. The young brakeman was 
among them. He asked, pointing after her, "Who is that?" 

"That's who runs Taggart Transcontinental," said the engineer; the respect 
in his voice was genuine. "That's the Vice-president in Charge of Operation." 

When the train jolted forward, the blast of its whistle dying over the 
fields, she sat by the window, lighting another cigarette. She thought: It's 
cracking to pieces, like this, all over the country, you can expect it 
anywhere, at any moment. But she felt no anger or anxiety; she had no time to 
feel. 

This would be just one more issue, to be settled along with the others. 
She knew that the superintendent of the Ohio Division was no good and that he 
was a friend of James Taggart. She had not insisted on throwing him out long 
ago only because she had no better man to put in his place. Good men were so 
strangely hard to find. But she would have to get rid of him, she thought, 
and she would give his post to Owen Kellogg, the young engineer who was doing 
a brilliant job as one of the assistants to the manager of the Taggart 



Terminal in New York; it was Owen Kellogg who ran the Terminal. She had 
watched his work for some time; she had always looked for sparks of 
competence, like a diamond prospector in an unpromising wasteland. Kellogg 
was still too young to be made superintendent of a division; she had wanted 
to give him another year, but there was no time to wait. She would have to 
speak to him as soon as she returned. 

The strip of earth, faintly visible outside the window, was running faster 
now, blending into a gray stream. Through the dry phrases of calculations in 
her mind, she noticed that she did have time to feel something: it was the 
hard, exhilarating pleasure of action. 

-k -k -k 

With the first whistling rush of air, as the Comet plunged into the 
tunnels of the Taggart Terminal under the city of New York, Dagny Taggart sat 
up straight. She always felt it when the train went underground— this sense of 
eagerness, of hope and of secret excitement. It was as if normal existence 
were a photograph of shapeless things in badly printed colors, but this was a 
sketch done in a few sharp strokes that made things seem clean, important— and 
worth doing. 

She watched the tunnels as they flowed past: bare walls of concrete, a net 
of pipes and wires, a web of rails that went off into black holes where green 
and red lights hung as distant drops of color. There was nothing else, 
nothing to dilute it, so that one could admire naked purpose and the 
ingenuity that had achieved it. She thought of the Taggart Building standing 
above her head at this moment, growing straight to the sky, and she thought: 
These are the roots of the building, hollow roots twisting under the ground, 
feeding the city. 

When the train stopped, when she got off and heard the concrete of the 
platform under her heels, she felt light, lifted, impelled to action. 

She started off, walking fast, as if the speed of her steps could give 
form to the things she felt. It was a few moments before she realized that 
she was whistling a piece of music— and that it was the theme of Halley's 
Fifth Concerto. She felt someone looking at her and turned. The young 
brakeman stood watching her tensely. 

She sat on the arm of the big chair facing James Taggart 's desk, her coat 
thrown open over a wrinkled traveling suit. Eddie Willers sat across the 
room, making notes once in a while. His title was that of Special Assistant 
to the Vice-President in Charge of Operation, and his main duty was to be her 
bodyguard against any waste of time. She asked him to be present at 
interviews of this nature, because then she never had to explain anything to 
him afterwards. James Taggart sat at his desk, his head drawn into his 
shoulders . 

"The Rio Norte Line is a pile of junk from one end to the other," she 
said. "It's much worse than I thought. But we're going to save it." 
"Of course," said James Taggart. 

"Some of the rail can be salvaged. Not much and not for long. We'll start 
laying new rail in the mountain sections, Colorado first. We'll get the new 
rail in two months." 

"Oh, did Orren Boyle say he'll-" 

"I've ordered the rail from Rearden Steel." 

The slight, choked sound from Eddie Willers was his suppressed desire to 
cheer . 

James Taggart did not answer at once. "Dagny, why don't you sit in the 
chair as one is supposed to?" he said at last; his voice was petulant. 
"Nobody holds business conferences this way." 
"I do." 



She waited. He asked, his eyes avoiding hers, "Did you say that you have 
ordered the rail from Rearden?" 

"Yesterday evening. I phoned him from Cleveland." 

"But the Board hasn't authorized it. I haven't authorized it. You haven't 
consulted me . " 

She reached over, picked up the receiver of a telephone on his desk and 
handed it to him. 

"Call Rearden and cancel it, " she said. 

James Taggart moved back in his chair. "I haven't said that," he answered 
angrily. "I haven't said that at all." 
"Then it stands?" 
"I haven't said that, either." 

She turned. "Eddie, have them draw up the contract with Rearden Steel. Jim 
will sign it." She took a crumpled piece of notepaper from her pocket and 
tossed it to Eddie. "There's the figures and terms." 

Taggart said, "But the Board hasn't—" 

"The Board hasn't anything to do with it. They authorized you to buy the 
rail thirteen months ago. Where you buy it is up to you." 

"I don't think it's proper to make such a decision without giving the 
Board a chance to express an opinion. And I don't see why I should be made to 
take the responsibility." 

"I am taking it." 

"What about the expenditure which—" 

"Rearden is charging less than Orren Boyle's Associated Steel." 
"Yes, and what about Orren Boyle?" 

"I've cancelled the contract. We had the right to cancel it six months 
ago . " 

"When did you do that?" 
"Yesterday . " 

"But he hasn't called to have me confirm it." 
"He won't." 

Taggart sat looking down at his desk. She wondered why he resented the 
necessity of dealing with Rearden, and why his resentment had such an odd, 
evasive quality. Rearden Steel had been the chief supplier of Taggart 
Transcontinental for ten years, ever since the first Rearden furnace was 
fired, in the days when their father was president of the railroad. For ten 
years, most of their rail had come from Rearden Steel. There were not many 
firms in the country who delivered what was ordered, when and as ordered. 
Rearden Steel was one of them. 

If she were insane, thought Dagny, she would conclude that her brother 
hated to deal with Rearden because Rearden did his job with superlative 
efficiency; but she would not conclude it, because she thought that such a 
feeling was not within the humanly possible. 

"It isn't fair," said James Taggart. 

"What isn't?" 

"That we always give all our business to Rearden. It seems to me we should 
give somebody else a chance, too. Rearden doesn't need us; he's plenty big 
enough. We ought to help the smaller fellows to develop. Otherwise, we're 
just encouraging a monopoly." 

"Don't talk tripe, Jim," 

"Why do we always have to get things from Rearden?" 
"Because we always get them." 
"I don't like Henry Rearden." 

"I do. But what does that matter, one way or the other? We need rails and 
he's the only one who can give them to us." 

"The human element is very important. You have no sense of the human 
element at all." 



"We're talking about saving a railroad, Jim." 

"Yes, of course, of course, but still, you haven't any sense of the human 
element . " 

"No. I haven't." 

"If we give Rearden such a large order for steel rails—" 
"They're not going to be steel. They're Rearden Metal." 

She had always avoided personal reactions, but she was forced to break her 
rule when she saw the expression on Taggart's face. She burst out laughing. 

Rearden Metal was a new alloy, produced by Rearden after ten years of 
experiments. He had placed it on the market recently. He had received no 
orders and had found no customers. 

Taggart could not understand the transition from the laughter to the 
sudden tone of Dagny's voice; the voice was cold and harsh: "Drop it, Jim. I 
know everything you're going to say. Nobody's ever used it before. Nobody 
approves of Rearden Metal. Nobody's interested in it. Nobody wants it. Still, 
our rails are going to be made of Rearden Metal." 

"But ..." said Taggart, "but . . . but nobody's ever used it before!" 

He observed, with satisfaction, that she was silenced by anger. He liked 
to observe emotions; they were like red lanterns strung along the dark 
unknown of another's personality, marking vulnerable points. But how one 
could feel a personal emotion about a metal alloy, and what such an emotion 
indicated, was incomprehensible to him; so he could make no use of his 
discovery . 

"The consensus of the best metallurgical authorities," he said, "seems to 
be highly skeptical about Rearden Metal, contending—" 
"Drop it, Jim. " 

"Well, whose opinion did you take?" 
"I don't ask for opinions." 
"What do you go by?" 
"Judgment . " 

"Well, whose judgment did you take?" 
"Mine. " 

"But whom did you consult about it?" 
"Nobody. " 

"Then what on earth do you know about Rearden Metal?" 
"That it's the greatest thing ever put on the market." 
"Why?" 

"Because it's tougher than steel, cheaper than steel and will outlast any 
hunk of metal in existence." 
"But who says so?" 

"Jim, I studied engineering in college. When I see things, I see them." 
"What did you see?" 

"Rearden 's formula and the tests he showed me." 

"Well, if it were any good, somebody would have used it, and nobody has." 
He saw the flash of anger, and went on nervously: "How can you know it's 
good? How can you be sure? How can you decide?" 

"Somebody decides such things, Jim. Who?" 

"Well, I don't see why we have to be the first ones. I don't see it at 
all." 

"Do you want to save the Rio Norte Line or not?" He did not answer, "If 
the road could afford it, I would scrap every piece of rail over the whole 
system and replace it with Rearden Metal. All of it needs replacing. None of 
it will last much longer. But we can't afford it. We have to get out of a bad 
hole, first. Do you want us to pull through or not?" 

"We're still the best railroad in the country. The others are doing much 
worse . " 

"Then do you want us to remain in the hole?" 



"I haven't said that! Why do you always oversimplify things that way? And 
if you're worried about money, I don't see why you want to waste it on the 
Rio Norte Line, when the Phoenix-Durango has robbed us of all our business 
down there. Why spend money when we have no protection against a competitor 
who'll destroy our investment?" 

"Because the Phoenix-Durango is an excellent railroad, but I intend to 
make the Rio Norte Line better than that. Because I'm going to beat the 
Phoenix-Durango, if necessary— only it won't be necessary, because there will 
be room for two or three railroads to make fortunes in Colorado. Because I'd 
mortgage the system to build a branch to any district around Ellis Wyatt." 

"I'm sick of hearing about Ellis Wyatt." 

He did not like the way her eyes moved to look at him and remained still, 
looking, for a moment. 

"I don't see any need for immediate action," he said; he sounded offended. 
"Just what do you consider so alarming in the present situation of Taggart 
Transcontinental ? " 

"The consequences of your policies, Jim." 

"Which policies?" 

"That thirteen months' experiment with Associated Steel, for one. Your 
Mexican catastrophe, for another." 

"The Board approved the Associated Steel contract," he said hastily. 

"The Board voted to build the San Sebastian Line. Besides, I don't see why 
you call it a catastrophe." 

"Because the Mexican government is going to nationalize your line any day 
now . " 

"That's a lie!" His voice was almost a scream. "That's nothing but vicious 
rumors! I have it on very good inside authority that—" 

"Don't show that you're scared, Jim," she said contemptuously. He did not 
answer. "It's no use getting panicky about it now," she said. "All we can do 
is try to cushion the blow. It's going to be a bad blow. Forty million 
dollars is a loss from which we won't recover easily. But Taggart 
transcontinental has withstood many bad shocks in the past. I'll see to it 
that it withstands this one." 

"I refuse to consider, I absolutely refuse to consider the possibility of 
the San Sebastian Line being nationalized!" 

"All right. Don't consider it." 

She remained silent. He said defensively, "I don't see why you're so eager 
to give a chance to Ellis Wyatt, yet you think it's wrong to take part in 
developing an underprivileged country that never had a chance." 

"Ellis Wyatt is not asking anybody to give him a chance. And I'm not in 
business to give chances. I'm running a railroad." 

"That's an extremely narrow view, it seems to me. I don't see why we 
should want to help one man instead of a whole nation." 

"I'm not interested in. helping anybody. I want to make money." 

"That's an impractical attitude. Selfish greed for profit is a thing of 
the past. It has been generally conceded that the interests of society as a 
whole must always be placed first in any business undertaking which—" 

"How long do you intend to talk in order to evade the issue, Jim?" 

"What issue?" 

"The order for Rearden Metal." 

He did not answer. He sat studying her silently. Her slender body, about 
to slump from exhaustion, was held erect by the straight line of the 
shoulders, and the shoulders were held by a conscious effort of will. Few 
people liked her face: the face was too cold, the eyes too intense; nothing 
could ever lend her the charm of a soft focus. The beautiful legs, slanting 
down from the chair's arm in the center of his vision, annoyed him; they 
spoiled the rest of his estimate. 



She remained silent; he was forced to ask, "Did you decide to order it 
just like that, on the spur of the moment, over a telephone?" 

"I decided it six months ago. I was waiting for Hank Rearden to get ready 
to go into production." 

"Don't call him Hank Rearden. It's vulgar." 

"That's what everybody calls him. Don't change the subject." 
"Why did you have to telephone him last night?" 
"Couldn't reach him sooner." 

"Why didn't you wait until you got back to New York and—" 
"Because I had seen the Rio Norte Line." 

"Well, I need time to consider it, to place the matter before the Board, 
to consult the best—" 
"There is no time." 

"You haven't given me a chance to form an opinion." 

"I don't give a damn about your opinion. I am not going to argue with you, 
with your Board or with your professors. You have a choice to make and you're 
going to make it now. Just say yes or no." 

"That's a preposterous, high-handed, arbitrary way of — " 

"Yes or no?" 

"That's the trouble with you. You always make it 'Yes' or 'No.' Things are 
never absolute like that. Nothing is absolute." 

"Metal rails are. Whether we get them or not, is." 
She waited. He did not answer. "Well?" she asked. 
"Are you taking the responsibility for it?" 
"I am." 

"Go ahead," he said, and added, "but at your own risk. I won't cancel it, 
but I won't commit myself as to what I'll say to the Board." 
"Say anything you wish." 

She rose to go. He leaned forward across the desk, reluctant to end the 
interview and to end it so decisively. 

"You realize, of course, that a lengthy procedure will be necessary to put 
this through," he said; the words sounded almost hopeful. "It isn't as simple 
as that." 

"Oh sure," she said. "I'll send you a detailed report, which Eddie will 
prepare and which you won't read. Eddie will help you put it through the 
works. I'm going to Philadelphia tonight to see Rearden. He and I have a lot 
of work to do." She added, "It's as simple as that, Jim." 

She had turned to go, when he spoke again— and what he said seemed 
bewilderingly irrelevant. "That's all right for you, because you're lucky. 
Others can't do it." 

"Do what?" 

"Other people are human. They're sensitive. They can't devote their whole 
life to metals and engines. You're lucky— you've never had any feelings. 
You've never felt anything at all." 

As she looked at him, her dark gray eyes went slowly from astonishment to 
stillness, then to a strange expression that resembled a look of weariness, 
except that it seemed to reflect much more than the endurance of this one 
moment . 

"No, Jim," she said quietly, "I guess I've never felt anything at all." 
Eddie Willers followed her to her office. Whenever she returned, he felt as 
if the world became clear, simple, easy to face— and he forgot his moments of 
shapeless apprehension. He was the only person who found it completely 
natural that she should be the Operating Vice-President of a great railroad, 
even though she was a woman. She had told him, when he was ten years old, 
that she would run the railroad some day. It did not astonish him now, just 
as it had not astonished him that day in a clearing of the woods. 



When they entered her office, when he saw her sit down at the desk and 
glance at the memos he had left for her— he felt as he did in his car when the 
motor caught on and the wheels could move forward. 

He was about to leave her office, when he remembered a matter he had not 
reported. "Owen Kellogg of the Terminal Division has asked me for an 
appointment to see you," he said. 

She looked up, astonished. "That's funny. I was going to send for him. 
Have him come up. I want to see him. . . . Eddie," she added suddenly, 
"before I start, tell them to get me Ayers of the Ayers Music Publishing 
Company on the phone . " 

"The Music Publishing Company?" he repeated incredulously. 

"Yes. There's something I want to ask him." 

When the voice of Mr. Ayers, courteously eager, inquired of what service 
he could be to her, she asked, "Can you tell me whether Richard Halley has 
written a new piano concerto, the Fifth?" 

"A fifth concerto, Miss Taggart? Why, no, of course he hasn't." 

"Are you sure?" 

"Quite sure, Miss Taggart. He has not written anything for eight years." 
"Is he still alive?" 

"Why, yes— that is, I can't say for certain, he has dropped out of public 
life entirely— but I'm sure we would have heard of it if he had died." 
"If he wrote anything, would you know about it?" 

"Of course. We would be the first to know. We publish all of his work. But 
he has stopped writing." 
"I see. Thank you." 

When Owen Kellogg entered her office, she looked at him with satisfaction. 
She was glad to see that she had been right in her vague recollection of his 
appearance— his face had the same quality as that of the young brakeman on the 
train, the face of the kind of man with whom she could deal. 

"Sit down, Mr. Kellogg," she said, but he remained standing in front of 
her desk. 

"You had asked me once to let you know if I ever decided to change my 
employment, Miss Taggart," he said. "So I came to tell you that I am 
quitting . " 

She had expected anything but that; it took her a moment before she asked 
quietly, "Why?" 

"For a personal reason." 
"Were you dissatisfied here?" 
"No . " 

"Have you received a better offer?" 
"No. " 

"What railroad are you going to?" 

"I'm not going to any railroad, Miss Taggart." 

"Then what job are you taking?" 

"I have not decided that yet." 

She studied him, feeling slightly uneasy. There was no hostility in his 
face; he looked straight at her, he answered simply, directly; he spoke like 
one who has nothing to hide, or to show; the face was polite and empty. 

"Then why should you wish to quit?" 

"It's a personal matter." 

"Are you ill? Is it a question of your health?" 
"No . " 

"Are you leaving the city?" 
"No . " 

"Have you inherited money that permits you to retire?" 
"No. " 

"Do you intend to continue working for a living?" 



"Yes." 

"But you do not wish to work for Taggart Transcontinental?" 
"No . " 

"In that case, something must have happened here to cause your decision. 
What?" 

"Nothing, Miss Taggart." 

"I wish you'd tell me. I have a reason for wanting to know." 
"Would you take my word for it, Miss Taggart?" 
"Yes . " 

"No person, matter or event connected with my job here had any bearing 
upon my decision." 

"You have no specific complaint against Taggart Transcontinental?" 
"None. " 

"Then I think you might reconsider when you hear what I have to offer 
you . " 

"I'm sorry, Miss Taggart. I can't." 
"May I tell you what I have in mind?" 
"Yes, if you wish." 

"Would you take my word for it that I decided to offer you the post I'm 
going to offer, before you asked to see me? I want you to know that." 
"I will always take your word, Miss Taggart." 

"It's the post of Superintendent of the Ohio Division. It's yours, if you 
want it." 

His face showed no reaction, as if the words had no more significance for 
him than for a savage who had never heard of railroads. 
"I don't want it, Miss Taggart," he answered. 

After a moment, she said, her voice tight, "Write your own ticket, 
Kellogg. Name your price, I want you to stay. I can match anything any other 
railroad offers you." 

"I am not going to work for any other railroad." 

"I thought you loved your work." 

This was the first sign of emotion in him, just a slight widening of his 
eyes and an oddly quiet emphasis in his voice when he answered, "I do." 

"Then tell me what it is that I should say in order to hold you!" It had 
been involuntary and so obviously frank that he looked at her as if it had 
reached him. 

"Perhaps I am being unfair by coming here to tell you that I'm quitting, 
Miss Taggart. I know that you asked me to tell you because you wanted to have 
a chance to make me a counter-offer. So if I came, it looks as if I'm open to 
a deal. But I'm not. I came only because I ... I wanted to keep my word to 
you . " 

That one break in his voice was like a sudden flash that told her how much 
her interest and her request had meant to him; and that his decision had not 
been an easy one to make. 

"Kellogg, is there nothing I can offer you?" she asked. 

"Nothing, Miss Taggart. Nothing on earth." 

He turned to go. For the first time in her life, she felt helpless and 
beaten . 

"Why?" she asked, not addressing him. 

He stopped. He shrugged and smiled— he was alive for a moment and it was 
the strangest smile she had ever seen: it held secret amusement, and 
heartbreak, and an infinite bitterness. He answered: "Who is John Gait?" 



CHAPTER II 
THE CHAIN 



It began with a few lights. As a train of the Taggart line rolled toward 
Philadelphia, a few brilliant, scattered lights appeared in the darkness; 
they seemed purposeless in the empty plain, yet too powerful to have no 
purpose. The passengers watched them idly, without interest. 

The black shape of a structure came next, barely visible against the sky, 
then a big building, close to the tracks; the building was dark, and the 
reflections of the train lights streaked across the solid glass of its walls. 

An oncoming freight train hid the view, filling the windows with a rushing 
smear of noise. In a sudden break above the fiat cars, the passengers saw 
distant structures under a faint, reddish glow in the sky; the glow moved in 
irregular spasms, as if the structures were breathing. 

When the freight train vanished, they saw angular buildings wrapped in 
coils of steam. The rays of a few strong lights cut straight sheafs through 
the coils. The steam was red as the sky. 

The thing that came next did not look like a building, but like a shell of 
checkered glass enclosing girders, cranes and trusses in a solid, blinding, 
orange spread of flame. 

The passengers could not grasp the complexity of what seemed to be a city 
stretched for miles, active without sign of human presence. They saw towers 
that looked like contorted skyscrapers, bridges hanging in mid-air, and 
sudden wounds spurting fire from out of solid walls. They saw a line of 
glowing cylinders moving through the night; the cylinders were red-hot metal. 

An office building appeared, close to the tracks. The big neon sign on its 
roof lighted the interiors of the coaches as they went by. It said: REARDEN 
STEEL. 

A passenger, who was a professor of economics, remarked to his companion: 
"Of what importance is an individual in the titanic collective achievements 
of our industrial age?" Another, who was a journalist, made a note for future 
use in his column: "Hank Rearden is the kind of man who sticks his name on 
everything he touches. You may, from this, form your own opinion about the 
character of Hank Rearden." 

The train was speeding on into the darkness when a red gasp shot to the 
sky from behind a long structure. The passengers paid no attention; one more 
heat of steel being poured was not an event they had been taught to notice. 

It was the first heat for the first order of Rearden Metal. 

To the men at the tap-hole of the furnace inside the mills, the first 
break of the liquid metal into the open came as a shocking sensation of 
morning. The narrow streak pouring through space had the pure white color of 
sunlight. Black coils of steam were boiling upward, streaked with violent 
red. Fountains of sparks shot in beating spasms, as from broken arteries. The 
air seemed torn to rags, reflecting a raging flame that was not there, red 
blotches whirling and running through space, as if not to be contained within 
a man-made structure, as if about to consume the columns, the girders, the 
bridges of cranes overhead. But the liquid metal had no aspect of violence. 
It was a long white curve with the texture of satin and the friendly radiance 
of a smile. It flowed obediently through a spout of clay, with two brittle 
borders to restrain it. It fell through twenty feet of space, down into a 
ladle that held two hundred tons. A flow of stars hung above the stream, 
leaping out of its placid smoothness, looking delicate as lace and innocent 
as children's sparklers. 

Only at a closer glance could one notice that the white satin was boiling. 
Splashes flew out at times and fell to the ground below: they were metal and, 
cooling while hitting the soil, they burst into flame. 



Two hundred tons of a metal which was to be harder than steel, running 
liquid at a temperature of four thousand degrees, had the power to annihilate 
every wall of the structure and every one of the men who worked by the 
stream. But every inch of its course, every pound of its pressure and the 
content of every molecule within it, were controlled and made by a conscious 
intention that had worked upon it for ten years. 

Swinging through the darkness of the shed, the red glare kept stashing the 
face of a man who stood in a distant corner; he stood leaning against a 
column, watching. The glare cut a moment's wedge across his eyes, which had 
the color and quality of pale blue ice— then across the black web of the metal 
column and the ash-blond strands of his hair— then across the belt of his 
trenchcoat and the pockets where he held his hands. His body was tall and 
gaunt; he had always been too tall for those around him. His face was cut by 
prominent cheekbones and by a few sharp lines; they were not the lines of 
age, he had always had them: this had made him look old at twenty, and young 
now, at forty-five. 

Ever since he could remember, he had been told that his face was ugly, 
because it was unyielding, and cruel, because it was expressionless. It 
remained expressionless now, as he looked at the metal. He was Hank Rearden. 

The metal came rising to the top of the ladle and went running over with 
arrogant prodigality. Then the blinding white trickles turned to glowing 
brown, and in one more instant they were black icicles of metal, starting to 
crumble off. The slag was crusting in thick, brown ridges that looked like 
the crust of the earth. As the crust grew thicker, a few craters broke open, 
with the white liquid still boiling within. 

A man came riding through the air, in the cab of a crane overhead. He 
pulled a lever by the casual movement of one hand: steel hooks came down on a 
chain, seized the handles of the ladle, lifted it smoothly like a bucket of 
milk— and two hundred tons of metal went sailing through space toward a row of 
molds waiting to be filled. 

Hank Rearden leaned back, closing his eyes. He felt the column trembling 
with the rumble of the crane. The job was done, he thought. 

A worker saw him and grinned in understanding, like a fellow accomplice in 
a great celebration, who knew why that tall, blond figure had to be present 
here tonight. Rearden smiled in answer: it was the only salute he had 
received. Then he started back for his office, once again a figure with an 
expressionless face. 

It was late when Hank Rearden left his office that night to walk from his 
mills to his house. It was a walk of some miles through empty country, but he 
had felt like doing it, without conscious reason. 

He walked, keeping one hand in his pocket, his fingers closed about a 
bracelet. It was made of Rearden Metal, in the shape of a chain. His fingers 
moved, feeling its texture once in a while. It had taken ten years to make 
that bracelet. Ten years, he thought, is a long time. The road was dark, 
edged with trees. Looking up, he could see a few leaves against the stars; 
the leaves were twisted and dry, ready to fall. 

There were distant lights in the windows of houses scattered through the 
countryside; but the lights made the road seem lonelier. 

He never felt loneliness except when he was happy. He turned, once in a 
while, to look back at the red glow of the sky over the mills. He did not 
think of the ten years. What remained of them tonight was only a feeling 
which he could not name, except that it was quiet and solemn. The feeling was 
a sum, and he did not have to count again the parts that had gone to make it. 
But the parts, unrecalled, were there, within the feeling. They were the 
nights spent at scorching ovens in the research laboratory of the mills — the 
nights spent in the workshop of his home, over sheets of paper which he 
filled with formulas, then tore up in angry failure — the days when the young 



scientists of the small staff he had chosen to assist him waited for 
instructions like soldiers ready for a hopeless battle, having exhausted 
their ingenuity, still willing, but silent, with the unspoken sentence 
hanging in the air: "Mr. Rearden, it can't be done— "—the meals, interrupted 
and abandoned at the sudden flash of a new thought, a thought to be pursued 
at once, to be tried, to be tested, to be worked on for months, and to be 
discarded as another failure — the moments snatched from conferences, from 
contracts, from theduties of running the best steel mills in the country, 
snatched almostguiltily, as for a secret love — the one thought held immovably 
across a span of ten years, undereverything he did and everything he saw, the 
thought held in his mindwhen he looked at the buildings of a city, at the 
track of a railroad, atthe light in the windows of a distant farmhouse, at 
the knife in the handsof a beautiful woman cutting a piece of fruit at a 
banquet, the thought ofa metal alloy that would do more than steel had ever 
done, a metal thatwould be to steel what steel had been to iron — the acts of 
self-racking when he discarded a hope or a sample, not permitting himself to 
know that he was tired, not giving himself timeto feel, driving himself 
through the wringing torture of: "not good enough . . . still not good enough 
. . . " and going on with no motor save the conviction that it could be done— 
—then the day when it was done and its result was called Rearden Metal— — 
these were the things that had come to white heat, had melted and fused 
within him, and their alloy was a strange, quiet feeling that made him smile 
at the countryside in the darkness and wonder why happiness could hurt. 

After a while, he realized that he was thinking of his past, as if certain 
days of it were spread before him, demanding to be seen again. He did not 
want to look at them; he despised memories as a pointless indulgence. But 
then he understood that he thought of them tonight in honor of that piece of 
metal in his pocket. Then he permitted himself to look. 

He saw the day when he stood on a rocky ledge and felt a thread of sweat 
running from his temple down his neck. He was fourteen years old and it was 
his first day of work in the iron mines of Minnesota. He was trying to learn 
to breathe against the scalding pain in his chest. He stood, cursing himself, 
because he had made up his mind that he would not be tired. After a while, he 
went back to his task; he decided that pain was not a valid reason for 
stopping, He saw the day when he stood at the window of his office and looked 
at the mines; he owned them as of that morning. He was thirty years old. What 
had gone on in the years between did not matter, just as pain had not 
mattered. He had worked in mines, in foundries, in the steel mills of the 
north, moving toward the purpose he had chosen. All he remembered of those 
jobs was that the men around him had never seemed to know what to do, while 
he had always known. He remembered wondering why so many iron mines were 
closing, just as these had been about to close until he took them over. He 
looked at the shelves of rock in the distance. Workers were putting up a new 
sign above a gate at the end of a road: Rearden Ore. 

He saw an evening when he sat slumped across his desk in that office. 

It was late and his staff had left; so he could lie there alone, 
unwitnessed. He was tired. It was as if he had run a race against his own 
body, and all the exhaustion of years, which he had refused to acknowledge, 
had caught him at once and flattened him against the desk top. He felt 
nothing, except the desire not to move. He did not have the strength to feel- 
not even to suffer. He had burned everything there was to burn within him; he 
had scattered so many sparks to start so many things— and he wondered whether 
someone could give him now the spark he needed, now when he felt unable ever 
to rise again. He asked himself who had started him and kept him going. Then 
he raised his head. 



Slowly, with the greatest effort of his life, he made his body rise until 
he was able to sit upright with only one hand pressed to the desk and a 
trembling arm to support him. 

He never asked that question again. He saw the day when he stood on a hill 
and looked at a grimy wasteland of structures that had been a steel plant. It 
was closed and given up. He had bought it the night before. There was a 
strong wind and a gray light squeezed from among the clouds. In that light, 
he saw the brown-red of rust, like dead blood, on the steel of the giant 
cranes— and bright, green, living weeds, like gorged cannibals, growing over 
piles of broken glass at the foot of walls made of empty frames. At a gate in 
the distance, he saw the black silhouettes of men. They were the unemployed 
from the rotting hovels of what had once been a prosperous town. 

They stood silently, looking at the glittering car he had left at the gate 
of the mills; they wondered whether the man on the hill was the Hank Rearden 
that people were talking about, and whether it was true that the mills were 
to be reopened. "The historical cycle of steel-making in Pennsylvania is 
obviously running down, " a newspaper had said, "and experts agree that Henry 
Rearden 's venture into steel is hopeless. You may soon witness the 
sensational end of the sensational Henry Rearden." That was ten years ago. 
Tonight, the cold wind on his face felt like the wind of that day. He turned 
to look back. The red glow of the mills breathed in the sky, a sight as life- 
giving as a sunrise. These had been his stops, the stations which an express 
had reached and passed. He remembered nothing distinct of the years between 
them; the years were blurred, like a streak of speed. 

Whatever it was, he thought, whatever the strain and the agony, they were 
worth it, because they had made him reach this day— this day when the first 
heat of the first order of Rearden Metal had been poured, to become rails for 
Taggart Transcontinental. 

He touched the bracelet in his pocket. He had had it made from that first 
poured metal. It was for his wife. As he touched it, he realized suddenly 
that he had thought of an abstraction called "his wife"— not of the woman to 
whom he was married. 

He felt a stab of regret, wishing he had not made the bracelet, then a 
wave of self-reproach for the regret. He shook his head. This was not the 
time for his old doubts. He felt that he could forgive anything to anyone, 
because happiness was the greatest agent of purification. He felt certain 
that every living being wished him well tonight. He wanted to meet someone, 
to face the first stranger, to stand disarmed and open, and to say, "Look at 
me." People, he thought, were as hungry for a sight of joy as he had always 
been— for a moment's relief from that gray load of suffering which seemed so 
inexplicable and unnecessary. He had never been able to understand why men 
should be unhappy. 

The dark road had risen imperceptibly to the top of a hill. He stopped and 
turned. The red glow was a narrow strip, far to the west. Above it, small at 
a distance of miles, the words of a neon sign stood written on the blackness 
of the sky: REARDEN STEEL. He stood straight, as if before a bench of 
judgment. He thought that in the darkness of this night other signs were 
lighted over the country: Rearden Ore— Rearden Coal— Rearden Limestone. He 
thought of the days behind him. He wished it were possible to light a neon 
sign above them, saying: Rearden Life. 

He turned sharply and walked on. As the road came closer to his house, he 
noticed that his steps were slowing down and that something was ebbing away 
from his mood. He felt a dim reluctance to enter his home, which he did not 
want to feel. No, he thought, not tonight; they'll understand it, tonight. 
But he did not know, he had never defined, what it was that he wanted them to 
understand. 



He saw lights in the windows of the living room, when he approached his 
house. The house stood on a hill, rising before him like a big white bulk; it 
looked naked, with a few semi-colonial pillars for reluctant ornament; it had 
the cheerless look of a nudity not worth revealing. 

He was not certain whether his wife noticed him when he entered the living 
room. She sat by the fireplace, talking, the curve of her arm floating in 
graceful emphasis of her words. He heard a small break in her voice, and 
thought that she had seen him, but she did not look up and her sentence went 
on smoothly; he could not be certain, "—but it's just that a man of culture 
is bored with the alleged wonders of purely material ingenuity, " she was 
saying. "He simply refuses to get excited about plumbing." 

Then she turned her head, looked at Rearden in the shadows across the long 
room, and her arms spread gracefully, like two swan necks by her sides. 

"Why, darling," she said in a bright tone of amusement, "isn't it too 
early to come home? Wasn't there some slag to sweep or tuyeres to polish?" 

They all turned to him— his mother, his brother Philip and Paul Larkin, 
their old friend. 

"I'm sorry," he answered. "I know I'm late." 

"Don't say you're sorry," said his mother. "You could have telephoned." He 
looked at her, trying vaguely to remember something. 
"You promised to be here for dinner tonight." 

"Oh, that's right, I did. I'm sorry. But today at the mills, we poured—" 
He stopped; he did not know what made him unable to utter the one thing he 
had come home to say; he added only, "It's just that I . . . forgot." 

"That's what Mother means," said Philip. 

"Oh, let him get his bearings, he's not quite here yet, he's still at the 
mills," his wife said gaily. "Do take your coat off, Henry." 

Paul Larkin was looking at him with the devoted eyes of an inhibited dog. 
"Hello, Paul," said Rearden. "When did you get in?" 

"Oh, I just hopped down on the five thirty-five from New York." Larkin was 
smiling in gratitude for the attention. 

"Trouble?" 

"Who hasn't got trouble these days?" Larkin 's smile became resigned, to 
indicate that the remark was merely philosophical. "But no, no special 
trouble this time. I just thought I'd drop in to see you." 

His wife laughed. "You've disappointed him, Paul." She turned to Rearden. 
"Is it an inferiority complex or a superiority one, Henry? Do you believe 
that nobody can want to see you just for your own sake, or do you believe 
that nobody can get along without your help?" 

He wanted to utter an angry denial, but she was smiling at him as if this 
were merely a conversational joke, and he had no capacity for the sort of 
conversations which were not supposed to be meant, so he did not answer. He 
stood looking at her, wondering about the things he had never been able to 
understand . 

Lillian Rearden was generally regarded as a beautiful woman. She had a 
tall, graceful body, the kind that looked well in high-waisted gowns of the 
Empire style, which she made it a practice to wear. Her exquisite profile 
belonged to a cameo of the same period: its pure, proud lines and the 
lustrous, light brown waves of her hair, worn with classical simplicity, 
suggested an austere, imperial beauty. But when she turned full-face, people 
experienced a small shock of disappointment. 

Her face was not beautiful. The eyes were the flaw: they were vaguely 
pale, neither quite gray nor brown, lifelessly empty of expression. Rearden 
had always wondered, since she seemed amused so often, why there was no 
gaiety in her face. 

"We have met before, dear, " she said, in answer to his silent scrutiny, 
"though you don't seem to be sure of it." 



"Have you had any dinner, Henry?" his mother asked; there was a 
reproachful impatience in her voice, as if his hunger were a personal insult 
to her. 

"Yes ... No ... I wasn't hungry." 

"I'd better ring to have them—" 

"No, Mother, not now, it doesn't matter." 

"That's the trouble I've always had with you." She was not looking at him, 
but reciting words into space. "It's no use trying to do things for you, you 
don't appreciate it. I could never make you eat properly." 

"Henry, you work too hard," said Philip. "It's not good for you." 

Rearden laughed. "I like it." 

"That's what you tell yourself. It's a form of neurosis, you know. When a 
man drowns himself in work, it's because he's trying to escape from 
something. You ought to have a hobby." 

"Oh, Phil, for Christ's sake!" he said, and regretted the irritation in 
his voice. 

Philip had always been in precarious health, though doctors had found no 
specific defect in his loose, gangling body. He was thirty-eight, but his 
chronic weariness made people think at times that he was older than his 
brother . 

"You ought to learn to have some fun," said Philip. "Otherwise, you'll 
become dull and narrow. Single-tracked, you know. You ought to get out of 
your little private shell and take a look at the world. You don't want to 
miss life, the way you're doing." 

Fighting anger, Rearden told himself that this was Philip's form of 
solicitude. He told himself that it would be unjust to feel resentment: they 
were all trying to show their concern for him— and he wished these were not 
the things they had chosen for concern. 

"I had a pretty good time today, Phil," he answered, smiling— and wondered 
why Philip did not ask him what it was. 

He wished one of them would ask him. He was finding it hard to 
concentrate. The sight of the running metal was still burned into his mind, 
filling his consciousness, leaving no room for anything else. 

"You might have apologized, only I ought to know better than to expect 
it." It was his mother's voice; he turned: she was looking at him with that 
injured look which proclaims the long-bearing patience of the defenseless. 

"Mrs. Beecham was here for dinner," she said reproachfully. 

"What?" 

"Mrs. Beecham. My friend Mrs. Beecham." 
"Yes?" 

"I told you about her, I told you many times, but you never remember 
anything I say. Mrs. Beecham was so anxious to meet you, but she had to leave 
after dinner, she couldn't wait, Mrs. Beecham is a very busy person. She 
wanted so much to tell you about the wonderful work we're doing in our parish 
school, and about the classes in metal craftsmanship, and about the beautiful 
wrought-iron doorknobs that the little slum children are making all by 
themselves . " 

It took the whole of his sense of consideration to force himself to answer 
evenly, "I'm sorry if I disappointed you, Mother." 

"You're not sorry. You could've been here if you'd made the effort. But 
when did you ever make an effort for anybody but yourself? You're not 
interested in any of us or in anything we do. You think that if you pay the 
bills, that's enough, don't you? Money! That's all you know. And all you give 
us is money. Have you ever given us any time?" 

If this meant that she missed him, he thought, then it meant affection, 
and if it meant affection, then he was unjust to experience a heavy, murky 



feeling which kept him silent lest his voice betray that the feeling was 
disgust . 

"You don't care," her voice went half-spitting, half-begging on. "Lillian 
needed you today for a very important problem, but I told her it was no use 
waiting to discuss it with you." 

"Oh, Mother, it's not important!" said Lillian. "Not to Henry." 

He turned to her. He stood in the middle of the room, with his trenchcoat 
still on, as if he were trapped in an unreality that would not become real to 
him. 

"It's not important at all," said Lillian gaily; he could not tell whether 
her voice was apologetic or boastful. "It's not business. It's purely non- 
commercial . " 

"What is it?" 

"Just a party I'm planning to give." 
"A party?" 

"Oh, don't look frightened, it's not for tomorrow night. I know that 
you're so very busy, but it's for three months from now and I want it to be a 
very big, very special affair, so would you promise me to be here that night 
and not in Minnesota or Colorado or California?" 

She was looking at him in an odd manner, speaking too lightly and too 
purposefully at once, her smile overstressing an air of innocence and 
suggesting something like a hidden trump card. 

"Three months from now?" he said. "But you know that I can't tell what 
urgent business might come up to call me out of town." 

"Oh, I know! But couldn't I make a formal appointment with you, way in 
advance, just like any railroad executive, automobile manufacturer or junk— I 
mean, scrap— dealer ? They say you never miss an appointment. Of course, I'd 
let you pick the date to suit your convenience." She was looking up at him, 
her glance acquiring some special quality of feminine appeal by being sent 
from under her lowered forehead up toward his full height; she asked, a 
little too casually and too cautiously, "The date I had in mind was December 
tenth, but would you prefer the ninth or the eleventh?" 

"It makes no difference to me." 

She said gently, "December tenth is our wedding anniversary, Henry." 

They were all watching his face; if they expected a look of guilt, what 
they saw, instead, was a faint smile of amusement. She could not have 
intended this as a trap, he thought, because he could escape it so easily, by 
refusing to accept any blame for his f orgetf ulness and by leaving her 
spurned; she knew that his feeling for her was her only weapon. Her motive, 
he thought, was a proudly indirect attempt to test his feeling and to confess 
her own. A party was not his form of celebration, but it was hers. It meant 
nothing in his terms; in hers, it meant the best tribute she could offer to 
him and to their marriage. He had to respect her intention, he thought, even 
if he did not share her standards, even if he did not know whether he still 
cared for any tribute from her. He had to let her win, he thought, because 
she had thrown herself upon his mercy. He smiled, an open, unresentful smile 
in acknowledgment of her victory. "All right, Lillian," he said quietly, "I 
promise to be here on the night of December tenth." 

"Thank you, dear." Her smile had a closed, mysterious quality; he wondered 
why he had a moment's impression that his attitude had disappointed them all. 

If she trusted him, he thought, if her feeling for him was still alive, 
then he would match her trust. He had to say it; words were a lens to focus 
one's mind, and he could not use words for anything else tonight. "I'm sorry 
I'm late, Lillian, but today at the mills we poured the first heat of Rearden 
Metal . " 

There was a moment of silence. Then Philip said, "Well, that's nice." 
The others said nothing. 



He put his hand in his pocket. When he touched it, the reality of the 
bracelet swept out everything else; he felt as he had felt when the liquid 
metal had poured through space before him. 

"I brought you a present, Lillian." 

He did not know that he stood straight and that the gesture of his arm was 
that of a returning crusader offering his trophy to his love, when he dropped 
a small chain of metal into her lap. 

Lillian Rearden picked it up, hooked on the tips of two straight fingers, 
and raised it to the light. The links were heavy, crudely made, the shining 
metal had an odd tinge, it was greenish-blue. 

"What's that?" she asked. 

"The first thing made from the first heat of the first order of Rearden 
Metal . " 

"You mean," she said, "it's fully as valuable as a piece of railroad 
rails?" 

He looked at her blankly. 

She jingled the bracelet, making it sparkle under the light. "Henry, it's 
perfectly wonderful! What originality! I shall be the sensation of New York, 
wearing jewelry made of the same stuff as bridge girders, truck motors, 
kitchen stoves, typewriters, and— what was it you were saying about it the 
other day, darling?— soup kettles?" 

"God, Henry, but you're conceited!" said Philip. 

Lillian laughed. "He's a sentimentalist. All men are. But, darling, I do 
appreciate it. It isn't the gift, it's the intention, I know." 

"The intention's plain selfishness, if you ask me," said Rearden' s mother. 
"Another man would bring a diamond bracelet, if he wanted to give his wife a 
present, because it's' her pleasure he'd think of, not his own. But Henry 
thinks that just because he's made a new kind of tin, why, it's got to be 
more precious than diamonds to everybody, just because it's he that's made 
it. That's the way he's been since he was five years old— the most conceited 
brat you ever saw— and I knew he'd grow up to be the most selfish creature on 
God's earth." 

"No, it's sweet," said Lillian. "It's charming." She dropped the bracelet 
down on the table. She got up, put her hands on Rearden 's shoulders, and 
raising herself on tiptoe, kissed him on the cheek, saying, "Thank you, 
dear . " 

He did not move, did not bend his head down to her. After a while, he 
turned, took off his coat and sat down by the fire, apart from the others. He 
felt nothing but an immense exhaustion. 

He did not listen to their talk. He heard dimly that Lillian was arguing, 
defending him against his mother. 

"I know him better than you do," his mother was saying. "Hank Rearden' s 
not interested in man, beast or weed unless it's tied in some way to himself 
and his work. That's all he cares about. I've tried my best to teach him some 
humility, I've tried all my life, but I've failed." 

He had offered his mother unlimited means to live as and where she 
pleased; he wondered why she had insisted that she wanted to live with him. 
His success, he had thought, meant something to her, and if it did, then it 
was a bond between them, the only kind of bond he recognized; if she wanted a 
place in the home of her successful son, he would not deny it to her. 

"It's no use hoping to make a saint out of Henry, Mother," said Philip. 
"He wasn't meant to be one." 

"Oh but, Philip, you're wrong!" said Lillian. "You're so wrong! Henry has 
all the makings of a saint. That's the trouble." What did they seek from 
him?— thought Rearden— what were they after? He had never asked anything of 
them; it was they who wished to hold him, they who pressed a claim on him— and 
the claim seemed to have the form of affection, but it was a form which he 



found harder to endure than any sort of hatred. He despised causeless 
affection, just as he despised unearned wealth. They professed to love him 
for some unknown reason and they ignored all the things for which he could 
wish to be loved. He wondered what response they could hope to obtain from 
him in such manner— if his response was what they wanted. 

And it was, he thought; else why those constant complaints, those 
unceasing accusations about his indifference? Why that chronic air of 
suspicion, as if they were waiting to be hurt? He had never had a desire to 
hurt them, but he had always felt their defensive, reproachful expectation; 
they seemed wounded by anything he said, it was not a matter of his words or 
actions, it was almost . . . almost as if they were Wounded by the mere fact 
of his being. Don't start imagining the insane —he told himself severely, 
struggling to face the riddle with the strictest of his ruthless sense of 
justice. He could not condemn them without understanding; and he could not 
understand. 

Did he like them? No, he thought; he had wanted to like them, which was 
not the same. He had wanted it in the name of some unstated potentiality 
which he had once expected to see in any human being. He felt nothing for 
them now, nothing but the merciless zero of indifference, not even the regret 
of a loss. Did he need any person as part of his life? Did he miss the 
feeling he had wanted to feel? No, he thought. Had he ever missed it? Yes, he 
thought, in his youth; not any longer. 

His sense of exhaustion was growing; he realized that it was boredom. 

He owed them the courtesy of hiding it, he thought— and sat motionless, 
fighting a desire for sleep that was turning into physical pain. 

His eyes were closing, when he felt two soft, moist fingers touching his 
hand: Paul Larkin had pulled a chair to his side and was leaning over for a 
private conversation. 

"I don't care what the industry says about it, Hank, you've got a great 
product in Rearden Metal, a great product, it will make a fortune, like 
everything you touch." 

"Yes," said Rearden, "it will." 

"I just ... I just hope you don't run into trouble." 
"What trouble?" 

"Oh, I don't know . . . the way things are nowadays . . . there's people, 
who . . . but how can we tell? . . . anything can happen. . . ." 
"What trouble?" 

Larkin sat hunched, looking up with his gentle, pleading eyes. His short, 
plumpish figure always seemed unprotected and incomplete, as if he needed a 
shell to shrink into at the slightest touch. His wistful eyes, his lost, 
helpless, appealing smile served as substitute for the shell. The smile was 
disarming, like that of a boy who throws himself at the mercy of an 
incomprehensible universe. He was fifty-three years old. 

"Your public relations aren't any too good, Hank," he said. "You've always 
had a bad press." 

"So what?" 

"You're not popular, Hank." 

"I haven't heard any complaints from my customers." 

"That's not what I mean. You ought to hire yourself a good press agent to 
sell you to the public, " 

"What for? It's steel that I'm selling." 

"But you don't want to have the public against you. Public opinion, you 
know— it can mean a lot." 

"I don't think the public's against me. And I don't think that it means a 
damn, one way or another, " 

"The newspapers are against you." 

"They have time to waste. I haven't." 



"I don't like it, Hank. It's not good." 
"What?" 

"What they write about you." 
"What do they write about me?" 

"Well, you know the stuff. That you're intractable. That you're ruthless. 
That you won't allow anyone any voice in the running of your mills. 
That your only goal is to make steel and to make money." 
"But that is my only goal." 
"But you shouldn't say it." 
"Why not? What is it I'm supposed to say?" 
"Oh, I don't know . . . But your mills—" 
"They're my mills, aren't they?" 

"Yes, but— but you shouldn't remind people of that too loudly. . . . 
You know how it is nowadays. . . . They think that your attitude is anti- 
social . " 

"I don't give a damn what they think," 
Paul Larkin sighed. 

"What's the matter, Paul? What are you driving at?" 

"Nothing . . . nothing in particular. Only one never knows what can happen 
in times like these. . . . One has to be so careful . . ." 

Rearden chuckled. "You're not trying to worry about me, are you?" 

"It's just that I'm your friend, Hank. I'm your friend. You know how much 
I admire you . " 

Paul Larkin had always been unlucky. Nothing he touched ever came off 
quite well, nothing ever quite failed or succeeded. He was a businessman, but 
he could not manage to remain for long in any one line of business. At the 
moment, he was struggling with a modest plant that manufactured mining 
equipment . 

He had clung to Rearden for years, in awed admiration. He came for advice, 
he asked for loans at times, but not often; the loans were modest and were 
always repaid, though not always on time. His motive in the relationship 
seemed to resemble the need of an anemic person who receives a kind of living 
transfusion from the mere sight of a savagely overabundant vitality. 

Watching Larkin 's efforts, Rearden felt what he did when he watched an ant 
struggling under the load of a matchstick. It's so hard for him, thought 
Rearden, and so easy for me. So he gave advice, attention and a tactful, 
patient interest, whenever he could. 

"I'm your friend, Hank." 

Rearden looked at him inquiringly. 

Larkin glanced away, as if debating something in his mind. After a while, 
he asked cautiously, "How is your man in Washington?" 
"Okay, I guess." 

"You ought to be sure of it. It's important." He looked up at Rearden, and 
repeated with a kind of stressed insistence, as if discharging a painful 
moral duty, "Hank, it's very important." 

"I suppose so." 

"In fact, that's what I came here to tell you." 
"For any special reason?" 

Larkin considered it and decided that the duty was discharged. "No," 
he said. 

Rearden disliked the subject. He knew that it was necessary to have a man 
to protect him from the legislature; all industrialists had to employ such 
men. But he had never given much attention to this aspect of his business; he 
could not quite convince himself that it was necessary. 

An inexplicable kind of distaste, part fastidiousness, part boredom, 
stopped him whenever he tried to consider it. 



"Trouble is, Paul, " he said, thinking aloud, "that the men one has to pick 
for that job are such a crummy lot," 

Larkin looked away. "That's life," he said. 

"Damned if I see why. Can you tell me that? What's wrong with the world?" 

Larkin shrugged sadly. "Why ask useless questions? How deep is the ocean? 
How high is the sky? Who is John Gait?" 

Rearden sat up straight. "No," he said sharply. "No. There's no reason to 
feel that way." 

He got up. His exhaustion had gone while he talked about his business. He 
felt a sudden spurt of rebellion, a need to recapture and defiantly to 
reassert his own view of existence, that sense of it which he had held while 
walking home tonight and which now seemed threatened in some nameless manner. 

He paced the room, his energy returning. He looked at his family. 

They were bewildered, unhappy children— he thought— all of them, even his 
mother, and he was foolish to resent their ineptitude; it came from their 
helplessness, not from malice. It was he who had to make himself learn to 
understand them, since he had so much to give, since they could never share 
his sense of joyous, boundless power. 

He glanced at them from across the room. His mother and Philip were 
engaged in some eager discussion; but he noted that they were not really 
eager, they were nervous. Philip sat in a low chair, his stomach forward, his 
weight on his shoulder blades, as if the miserable discomfort of his position 
were intended to punish the onlookers. 

"What's the matter, Phil?" Rearden asked, approaching him. "You look done 
in. " 

"I've had a hard day," said Philip sullenly. 

"You're not the only one who works hard," said his mother. "Others have 
problems, too— even if they're not billion-dollar, trans-super-continental 
problems like yours." 

"Why, that's good. I always thought that Phil should find some interest of 
his own." 

"Good? You mean you like to see your brother sweating his health away? It 
amuses you, doesn't it? I always thought it did." 
"Why, no, Mother. I'd like to help." 

"You don't have to help. You don't have to feel anything for any of us." 

Rearden had never known what his brother was doing or wished to do. He had 
sent Philip through college, but Philip had not been able to decide on any 
specific ambition. There was something wrong, by Rearden 's standards, with a 
man who did not seek any gainful employment, but he would not impose his 
standards on Philip; he could afford to support his brother and never notice 
the expense. Let him take it easy, Rearden had thought for years, let him 
have a chance to choose his career without the strain of struggling for a 
livelihood . 

"What were you doing today, Phil?" he asked patiently. 
"It wouldn't interest you." 

"It does interest me. That's why I'm asking." 

"I had to see twenty different people all over the place, from here to 
Redding to Wilmington." 

"What did you have to see them about?" 

"I am trying to raise money for Friends of Global Progress." 

Rearden had never been able to keep track of the many organizations to 
which Philip belonged, nor to get a clear idea of their activities. He had 
heard Philip talking vaguely about this one for the last six months. 

It seemed to be devoted to some sort of free lectures on psychology, folk 
music and co-operative farming. Rearden felt contempt for groups of that kind 
and saw no reason for a closer inquiry into their nature. 



He remained silent. Philip added without being prompted, "We need ten 
thousand dollars for a vital program, but it's a martyr's task, trying to 
raise money. There's not a speck of social conscience left in people. 

When I think of the kind of bloated money-bags I saw today— why, they spend 
more than that on any whim, but I couldn't squeeze just a hundred bucks a 
piece out of them, which was all I asked. They have no sense of moral duty, 
no . . . What are you laughing at?" he asked sharply. Rearden stood before 
him, grinning. 

It was so childishly blatant, thought Rearden, so helplessly crude: the 
hint and the insult, offered together. It would be so easy to squash Philip 
by returning the insult, he thought— by returning an insult which would be 
deadly because it would be true— that he could not bring himself to utter it. 
Surely, he thought, the poor fool knows he's at my mercy, knows he's opened 
himself to be hurt, so I don't have to do it, and my not doing it is my best 
answer, which he won't be able to miss. 

What sort of misery does he really live in, to get himself twisted quite 
so badly? 

And then Rearden thought suddenly that he could break through Philip's 
chronic wretchedness for once, give him a shock of pleasure, the unexpected 
gratification of a hopeless desire. He thought: What do I care about the 
nature of his desire?— it's his, just as Rearden Metal was mine— it must mean 
to him what that meant to me— let's see him happy just once, it might teach 
him something— didn ' t I say that happiness is the agent of purification?— I ' m 
celebrating tonight, so let him share in it— it will be so much for him, and 
so little for me. 

"Philip," he said, smiling, "call Miss Ives at my office tomorrow. 

She'll have a check for you for ten thousand dollars." 

Philip stared at him blankly; it was neither shock nor pleasure; it was 
just the empty stare of eyes that looked glassy. 

"Oh," said Philip, then added, "We'll appreciate it very much." 

There was no emotion in his voice, not even the simple one of greed. 

Rearden could not understand his own feeling: it was as if something 
leaden and empty were collapsing within him, he felt both the weight and the 
emptiness, together. He knew it was disappointment, but he wondered why it 
was so gray and ugly. 

"It's very nice of you, Henry," Philip said dryly. "I'm surprised. I 
didn't expect it of you." 

"Don't you understand it, Phil?" said Lillian, her voice peculiarly clear 
and lilting. "Henry's poured his metal today." She turned to Rearden. "Shall 
we declare it a national holiday, darling?" 

"You're a good man, Henry," said his mother, and added, "but not often 
enough . " 

Rearden stood looking at Philip, as if waiting. 

Philip looked away, then raised his eyes and held Rearden 's glance, as if 
engaged in a scrutiny of his own. 

"You don't really care about helping the underprivileged, do you?" 

Philip asked— and Rearden heard, unable to believe it, that the tone of his 
voice was reproachful. 

"No, Phil, I don't care about it at all. I only wanted you to be happy." 

"But that money is not for me. I am not collecting it for any personal 
motive. I have no selfish interest in the matter whatever." His voice was 
cold, with a note of self-conscious virtue. 

Rearden turned away. He felt a sudden loathing: not because the words were 
hypocrisy, but because they were true; Philip meant them. 

"By the way, Henry, " Philip added, "do you mind if I ask you to have Miss 
Ives give me the money in cash?" Rearden turned back to him, puzzled. "You 
see, Friends of Global Progress are a very progressive group and they have 



always maintained that you represent the blackest element of social 
retrogression ha the country, so it would embarrass us, you know, to have 
your name on our list of contributors, because somebody might accuse us of 
being in the pay of Hank Rearden." 

He wanted to slap Philip's face. But an almost unendurable contempt made 
him close his eyes, instead. 

"All right," he said quietly, "you can have it in cash." 

He walked away, to the farthest window of the room, and stood looking at 
the glow of the mills in the distance. 

He heard Larkin's voice crying after him, "Damn it, Hank, you shouldn't 
have given it to him!" 

Then Lillian's voice came, cold and gay: "But you're wrong, Paul, you're 
so wrong! What would happen to Henry's vanity if he didn't have us to throw 
alms to? What would become of his strength if he didn't have weaker people to 
dominate? What would he do with himself if he didn't keep us around as 
dependents? It's quite all right, really, I'm not criticizing him, it's just 
a law of human nature." 

She took the metal bracelet and held it up, letting it glitter in the 
lamplight . 

"A chain," she said. "Appropriate, isn't it? It's the chain by which he 
holds us all in bondage." 



CHAPTER III 
THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM 



The ceiling was that of a cellar, so heavy and low that people stooped 
when crossing the room, as if the weight of the vaulting rested on their 
shoulders. The circular booths of dark red leather were built into walls of 
stone that looked eaten by age and dampness. There were no windows, only 
patches of blue light shooting from dents in the masonry, the dead blue light 
proper for use in blackouts. The place was entered by way of narrow steps 
that led down, as if descending deep under the ground. This was the most 
expensive barroom in New York and it was built on the roof of a skyscraper. 

Four men sat at a table. Raised sixty floors above the city, they did not 
speak loudly as one speaks from a height in the freedom of air and space; 
they kept their voices low, as befitted a cellar. 

"Conditions and circumstances, Jim," said Orren Boyle. "Conditions and 
circumstances absolutely beyond human control. We had everything mapped to 
roll those rails, but unforeseen developments set in which nobody could have 
prevented. If you'd only given us a chance, Jim." 

"Disunity, " drawled James Taggart, "seems to be the basic cause of all 
social problems. My sister has a certain influence with a certain element 
among our stockholders. Their disruptive tactics cannot always be defeated." 

"You said it, Jim. Disunity, that's the trouble. It's my absolute opinion 
that in our complex industrial society, no business enterprise can succeed 
without sharing the burden of the problems of other enterprises." 

Taggart took a sip of his drink and put it down again. "I wish they'd fire 
that bartender," he said. 

"For instance, consider Associated Steel. We've got the most modern plant 
in the country and the best organization. That seems to me to be an 
indisputable fact, because we got the Industrial Efficiency Award of Globe 
Magazine last year. So we can maintain that we've done our best and nobody 
can blame us. But we cannot help it if the iron ore situation is a national 
problem. We could not get the ore, Jim." 

Taggart said nothing. He sat with his elbows spread wide on the table top. 
The table was uncomfortably small, and this made it more uncomfortable for 
his three companions, but they did not seem to question his privilege. 

"Nobody can get ore any longer," said Boyle. "Natural exhaustion of the 
mines, you know, and the wearing out of equipment, and shortages of 
materials, and difficulties of transportation, and other unavoidable 
conditions . " 

"The ore industry is crumbling. That's what's killing the mining equipment 
business," said Paul Larkin. 

"It's been proved that every business depends upon every other business," 
said Orren Boyle. "So everybody ought to share the burdens of everybody 
else . " 

"That is, I think, true," said Wesley Mouch. But nobody ever paid any 
attention to Wesley Mouch. 

"My purpose," said Orren Boyle, "is the preservation of a free economy. 
It's generally conceded that free economy is now on trial. Unless it proves 
its social value and assumes its social responsibilities, the people won't 
stand for it. If it doesn't develop a public spirit, it's done for, make no 
mistake about that." 

Orren Boyle had appeared from nowhere, five years ago, and had since made 
the cover of every national news magazine. He had started out with a hundred 
thousand dollars of his own and a two-hundred million-dollar loan from the 
government. Now he headed an enormous concern which had swallowed many 



smaller companies. This proved, he liked to say, that individual ability 
still had a chance to succeed in the world. 

"The only justification of private property," said Orren Boyle, "is public 
service . " 

"That is, I think, indubitable," said Wesley Mouch. 

Orren Boyle made a noise, swallowing his liquor. He was a large man with 
big, virile gestures; everything about his person was loudly full of life, 
except the small black slits of his eyes. 

"Jim," he said, "Rearden Metal seems to be a colossal kind of swindle." 

"Uh-huh, " said Taggart. 

"I hear there's not a single expert who's given a favorable report on it." 
"No, not one . " 

"We've been improving steel rails for generations, and increasing their 
weight. Now, is it true that these Rearden Metal rails are to be lighter than 
the cheapest grade of steel?" 

"That's right," said Taggart. "Lighter." 

"But it's ridiculous, Jim. It's physically impossible. For your heavy- 
duty, high-speed, main-line track?" 
"That's right." 

"But you're just inviting disaster." 
"My sister is . " 

Taggart made the stem of his glass whirl slowly between two fingers. 
There was a moment of silence. 

"The National Council of Metal Industries," said Orren Boyle, "passed a 
resolution to appoint a committee to study the question of Rearden Metal, 
inasmuch as its use may be an actual public hazard." 

"That is, in my opinion, wise," said Wesley Mouch. 

"When everybody agrees," Taggart 's voice suddenly went shrill, "when 
people are unanimous, how does one man dare to dissent? By what right? That's 
what I want to know— by what right?" 

Boyle's eyes darted to Taggart ' s face, but the dim light of the room made 
it impossible to see faces clearly: he saw only a pale, bluish smear. 

"When we think of the natural resources, at a time of critical shortage," 
Boyle said softly, "when we think of the crucial raw materials that are being 
wasted on an irresponsible private experiment, when we think of the ore . . 

He did not finish. He glanced at Taggart again. But Taggart seemed to know 
that Boyle was waiting and to find the silence enjoyable. 

"The public has a vital stake in natural resources, Jim, such as iron ore. 
The public can't remain indifferent to reckless, selfish waste by an anti- 
social individual. After all, private property is a trusteeship held for the 
benefit of society as a whole." 

Taggart glanced at Boyle and smiled; the smile was pointed, it seemed to 
say that something in his words was an answer to something in the words of 
Boyle. "The liquor they serve here is swill. I suppose that's the price we 
have to pay for not being crowded by all kinds of rabble. But I do wish 
they'd recognize that they're dealing with experts. 

Since I hold the purse strings, I expect to get my money's worth and at my 
pleasure . " 

Boyle did not answer; his face had become sullen. "Listen, Jim . . ." 
he began heavily. 

Taggart smiled. "What? I'm listening." 

"Jim, you will agree, I'm sure, that there's nothing more destructive than 
a monopoly." 

"Yes," said Taggart, "on the one hand. On the other, there's the blight of 
unbridled competition." 



"That's true. That's very true. The proper course is always, in my 
opinion, in the middle. So it is, I think, the duty of society to snip the 
extremes, now isn't it?" 

"Yes," said Taggart, "it is." 

"Consider the picture in the iron-ore business. The national output seems 
to be falling at an ungodly rate. It threatens the existence of the whole 
steel industry. Steel mills are shutting down all over the country. 

There's only one mining company that's lucky enough not to be affected by 
the general conditions. Its output seems to be plentiful and always available 
on schedule. But who gets the benefit of it? Nobody except its owner. Would 
you say that that's fair?" 

"No," said Taggart, "it isn't fair." 

"Most of us don't own iron mines. How can we compete with a man who's got 
a corner on God's natural resources? Is it any wonder that he can always 
deliver steel, while we have to struggle and wait and lose our customers and 
go out of business? Is it in the public interest to let one man destroy an 
entire industry?" 

"No," said Taggart, "it isn't." 

"It seems to me that the national policy ought to be aimed at the 
objective of giving everybody a chance at his fair share of iron ore, with a 
view toward the preservation of the industry as a whole. Don't you think so?" 

"I think so." 

Boyle sighed. Then he said cautiously, "But I guess there aren't many 
people in Washington capable of understanding a progressive social policy." 

Taggart said slowly, "There are. No, not many and not easy to approach, 
but there are. I might speak to them." 

Boyle picked up his drink and swallowed it in one gulp, as if he had heard 
all he had wanted to hear. 

"Speaking of progressive policies, Orren, " said Taggart, "you might ask 
yourself whether at a time of transportation shortages, when so many 
railroads are going bankrupt and large areas are left without rail service, 
whether it is in the public interest to tolerate wasteful duplication of 
services and the destructive, dog-eat-dog competition of newcomers in 
territories where established companies have historical priority." 

"Well, now," said Boyle pleasantly, "that seems to be an interesting 
question to consider. I might discuss it with a few friends in the National 
Alliance of Railroads." 

"Friendships," said Taggart in the tone of an idle abstraction, "are more 
valuable than gold." Unexpectedly, he turned to Larkin. "Don't you think so, 
Paul?" 

"Why . . . yes," said Larkin, astonished. "Yes, of course." 

"I am counting on yours." 

"Huh?" 

"I am counting on your many friendships." 

They all seemed to know why Larkin did not answer at once; his shoulders 
seemed to shrink down, closer to the table. "If everybody could pull for a 
common purpose, then nobody would have to be hurt!" 

he cried suddenly, in a tone of incongruous despair; he saw Taggart 
watching him and added, pleading, "I wish we didn't have to hurt anybody." 

"That is an anti-social attitude," drawled Taggart. "People who are 
afraid, to sacrifice somebody have no business talking about a common 
purpose . " 

"But I'm a student of history," said Larkin hastily. "I recognize 
historical necessity." 
"Good," said Taggart. 

"I can't be expected to buck the trend of the whole world, can I?" 
Larkin seemed to plead, but the plea was not addressed to anyone. 



"Can I?" 

"You can't, Mr. Larkin, " said Wesley Mouch. "You and I are not to be 
blamed, if we—" 

Larkin jerked his head away; it was almost a shudder; he could not bear to 
look at Mouch. 

"Did you have a good time in Mexico, Orren?" asked Taggart, his voice 
suddenly loud and casual. All of them seemed to know that the purpose of 
their meeting was accomplished and whatever they had come here to understand 
was understood. 

"Wonderful place, Mexico," Boyle answered cheerfully. "Very stimulating 
and thought-provoking. Their food rations are something awful, though. I got 
sick. But they're working mighty hard to put their country on its feet." 

"How are things going down there?" 

"Pretty splendid, it seems to me, pretty splendid. Right at the moment, 
however, they're . . . But then, what they're aiming at is the future. The 
People's State of Mexico has a great future. They'll beat us all in a few 
years . " 

"Did you go down to the San Sebastian Mines?" 

The four figures at the table sat up straighter and tighter; all of them 
had invested heavily in the stock of the San Sebastian Mines. 

Boyle did not answer at once, so that his voice seemed unexpected and 
unnaturally loud when it burst forth: "Oh, sure, certainly, that's what I 
wanted to see most." 

"And?" 

"And what?" 

"How are things going?" 

"Great. Great. They must certainly have the biggest deposits of copper on 
earth, down inside that mountain!" 
"Did they seem to be busy?" 
"Never saw such a busy place in my life." 
"What were they busy doing?" 

"Well, you know, with the kind of Spic superintendent they have down 
there, I couldn't understand half of what he was talking about, but they're 
certainly busy." 

"Any . . . trouble of any kind?" 

"Trouble? Not at San Sebastian. It's private property, the last piece of 
it left in Mexico, and that does seem to make a difference." 

"Orren," Taggart asked cautiously, "what about those rumors that they're 
planning to nationalize the San Sebastian Mines?" 

"Slander," said Boyle angrily, "plain, vicious slander. I know it for 
certain. I had dinner with the Minister of Culture and lunches with all the 
rest of the boys." 

"There ought to be a law against irresponsible gossip, " said Taggart 
sullenly. "Let's have another drink." 

He waved irritably at a waiter. There was a small bar in a dark corner of 
the room, where an old, wizened bartender stood for long stretches of time 
without moving. When called upon, he moved with contemptuous slowness. His 
job was that of servant to men's relaxation and pleasure, but his manner was 
that of an embittered quack ministering to some guilty disease. 

The four men sat in silence until the waiter returned with their drinks. 
The glasses he placed on the table were four spots of faint blue glitter in 
the semi-darkness, like four feeble jets of gas flame. Taggart reached for 
his glass and smiled suddenly. 

"Let's drink to the sacrifices to historical necessity," he said, looking 
at Larkin. 

There was a moment's pause; in a lighted room, it would have been the 
contest of two men holding each other's eyes; here, they were merely looking 



at each other's eye sockets. Then Larkin picked up his glass, "It's my party, 
boys," said Taggart, as they drank. 

Nobody found anything else to say. until Boyle spoke up with indifferent 
curiosity. "Say, Jim, I meant to ask you, what in hell's the matter with your 
train service down on the San Sebastian Line?" 

"Why, what do you mean? What is the matter with it?" 

"Well, I don't know, but running just one passenger train a day is—" 
"One train?" 

"—is pretty measly service, it seems to me, and what a train! You must 
have inherited those coaches from your great-grandfather, and he must have 
used them pretty hard. And where on earth did you get that wood-burning 
locomotive? " 

"Wood-burning? ' 

"That's what I said, wood-burning. I never saw one before, except in 
photographs. What museum did you drag it out of? Now don't act as if you 
didn't know it, just tell me what's the gag?" 

"Yes, of course I knew it," said Taggart hastily. "It was just . . . 

You just happened to choose the one week when we had a little trouble with 
our motive power— our new engines are on order, but there's been a slight 
delay— you know what a problem we're having with the manufacturers of 
locomotives— but it's only temporary." 

"Of course," said Boyle. "Delays can't be helped. It's the strangest train 
I ever rode on, though. Nearly shook my guts out." 

Within a few minutes, they noticed that Taggart had become silent. 

He seemed preoccupied with a problem of his own. When he rose abruptly, 
without apology, they rose, too, accepting it as a command. 

Larkin muttered, smiling too strenuously, "It was a pleasure, Jim. 

A pleasure. That's how great projects are born— over a drink with friends." 

"Social reforms are slow," said Taggart coldly. "It is advisable to be 
patient and cautious." For the first time, he turned to Wesley Mouch. 

"What I like about you, Mouch, is that you don't talk too much." 

Wesley Mouch was Rearden's Washington man. 

There was still a remnant of sunset light in the sky, when Taggart and 
Boyle emerged together into the street below. The transition was faintly 
shocking to them— the enclosed barroom led one to expect midnight darkness. A 
tall building stood outlined against the sky, sharp and straight like a 
raised sword. In the distance beyond it, there hung the calendar. 

Taggart fumbled irritably with his coat collar, buttoning it against the 
chill of the streets. He had not intended to go back to the office tonight, 
but he had to go back. He had to see his sister. 

". . .a difficult undertaking ahead of us, Jim," Boyle was saying, "a 
difficult undertaking, with so many dangers and complications and so much at 
stake ..." 

"It all depends," James Taggart answered slowly, "on knowing the people 
who make it possible. . . . That's what has to be known— who makes it 
possible . " 

Dagny Taggart was nine years old when she decided that she would run the 
Taggart Transcontinental Railroad some day. She stated it to herself when she 
stood alone between the rails, looking at the two straight lines of steel 
that went off into the distance and met in a single point. What she felt was 
an arrogant pleasure at the way the track cut through the woods: it did not 
belong in the midst of ancient trees, among green branches that hung down to 
meet green brush and the lonely spears of wild flowers— but there it was. The 
two steel lines were brilliant in the sun, and the black ties were like the 
rungs of a ladder which she had to climb. 

It was not a sudden decision, but only the final seal of words upon 
something she had known long ago. In unspoken understanding, as if bound by a 



vow it had never been necessary to take, she and Eddie Willers had given 
themselves to the railroad from the first conscious days of their childhood. 

She felt a bored indifference toward the immediate world around her, 
toward other children and adults alike. She took it as a regrettable 
accident, to be borne patiently for a while, that she happened to be 
imprisoned among people who were dull. She had caught a glimpse of another 
world and she knew that it existed somewhere, the world that had created 
trains, bridges, telegraph wires and signal lights winking in the night. She 
had to wait, she thought, and grow up to that world. 

She never tried to explain why she liked the railroad. Whatever it was 
that others felt, she knew that this was one emotion for which they had no 
equivalent and no response. She felt the same emotion in school, in classes 
of mathematics, the only lessons she liked. She felt the excitement of 
solving problems, the insolent delight of taking up a challenge and disposing 
of it without effort, the eagerness to meet another, harder test. She felt, 
at the same time, a growing respect for the adversary, for a science that was 
so clean, so strict, so luminously rational. Studying mathematics, she felt, 
quite simply and at once: "How great that men have done this" and "How 
wonderful that I'm so good at it." It was the joy of admiration and of one's 
own ability, growing together. Her feeling for the railroad was the same: 
worship of the skill that had gone to make it, of the ingenuity of someone's 
clean, reasoning mind, worship with a secret smile that said she would know 
how to make it better some day. She hung around the tracks and the 
roundhouses like a humble student, but the humility had a touch of future 
pride, a pride to be earned. 

"You're unbearably conceited," was one of the two sentences she heard 
throughout her childhood, even though she never spoke of her own ability. The 
other sentence was: "You're selfish." She asked what was meant, but never 
received an answer. She looked at the adults, wondering how they could 
imagine that she would feel guilt from an undefined accusation. 

She was twelve years old when she told Eddie Willers that she would run 
the railroad when they grew up. She was fifteen when it occurred to her for 
the first time that women did not run railroads and that people might object. 
To hell with that, she thought— and never worried about it again. 

She went to work for Taggart Transcontinental at the age of sixteen. 

Her father permitted it: he was amused and a little curious. She started 
as night operator at a small country station. She had to work nights for the 
first few years, while attending a college of engineering. 

James Taggart began his career on the railroad at the same time; he was 
twenty-one. He started in the Department of Public Relations. 

Dagny's rise among the men who operated Taggart Transcontinental was swift 
and uncontested. She took positions of responsibility because there was no 
one else to take them. There were a few rare men of talent around her, but 
they were becoming rarer every year. Her superiors, who held the authority, 
seemed afraid to exercise it, they spent their time avoiding decisions, so 
she told people what to do and they did it. 

At every step of her rise, she did the work long before she was granted 
the title. It was like advancing through empty rooms. Nobody opposed her, yet 
nobody approved of her progress. 

Her father seemed astonished and proud of her, but he said nothing and 
there was sadness in his eyes when he looked at her in the office She was 
twenty-nine years old when he died. "There has always been a Taggart to run 
the railroad," was the last thing he said to her. He looked at her with an 
odd glance: it had the quality of a salute and of compassion, together. 

The controlling stock of Taggart Transcontinental was left to James 
Taggart. He was thirty-four when he became President of the railroad Dagny 
had expected the Board of Directors to elect him, but she had never been able 



to understand why they did it so eagerly. They talked about tradition, the 
president had always been the eldest son of the Taggart family; they elected 
James Taggart in the same manner as they refused to walk under a ladder, to 
propitiate the same kind of fear. They talked about his gift of "making 
railroads popular," his "good press," his "Washington ability." He seemed 
unusually skillful at obtaining favors from the Legislature. 

Dagny knew nothing about the field of "Washington ability" or what such an 
ability implied. But it seemed to be necessary, so she dismissed it with the 
thought that there were many kinds of work which were offensive, yet 
necessary, such as cleaning sewers; somebody had to do it, and Jim seemed to 
like it. 

She had never aspired to the presidency; the Operating Department was her 
only concern. When she went out on the line, old railroad men, who hated Jim, 
said, "There will always be a Taggart to run the railroad, " looking at her as 
her father had looked. She was armed against Jim by the conviction that he 
was not smart enough to harm the railroad too much and that she would always 
be able to correct whatever damage he caused. 

At sixteen, sitting at her operator's desk, watching the lighted windows 
of Taggart trains roll past, she had thought that she had entered her kind of 
world. In the years since, she learned that she hadn't. The adversary she 
found herself forced to fight was not worth matching or beating; it was not a 
superior ability which she would have found honor in challenging; it was 
ineptitude— a gray spread of cotton that deemed soft and shapeless, that could 
offer no resistance to anything or anybody, yet managed to be a barrier in 
her way. She stood, disarmed, before the riddle of what made this possible. 
She could find no answer. 

It was only in the first few years that she felt herself screaming 
silently, at times, for a glimpse of human ability, a single glimpse of 
clean, hard, radiant competence. She had fits of tortured longing for a 
friend or an enemy with a mind better than her own. But the longing passed. 
She had a job to do. She did not have time to feel pain; not often. 

The first step of the policy that James Taggart brought to the railroad 
was the construction of the San Sebastian Line. Many men were responsible for 
it; but to Dagny, one name stood written across that venture, a name that 
wiped out all others wherever she saw it. It stood across five years of 
struggle, across miles of wasted track, across sheets of figures that 
recorded the losses of Taggart Transcontinental like a red trickle from a 
wound which would not heal— as it stood on the ticker tape of every stock 
exchange left in the world— as it stood on smokestacks in the red glare of 
furnaces melting copper— as it stood in scandalous headlines— as it stood on 
parchment pages recording the nobility of the centuries— as it stood on cards 
attached to flowers in the boudoirs of women scattered through three 
continents . 

The name was Francisco d'Anconia. 

At the age of twenty-three, when he inherited his fortune, Francisco 
d'Anconia had been famous as the copper king of the world. Now, at thirty- 
six, he was famous as the richest man and the most spectacularly worthless 
playboy on earth. He was the last descendant of one of the noblest families 
of Argentina. He owned cattle ranches, coffee plantations and most of the 
copper mines of Chile. He owned half of South America and sundry mines 
scattered through the United States as small change. 

When Francisco d'Anconia suddenly bought miles of bare mountains in 
Mexico, news leaked out that he had discovered vast deposits of copper. He 
made no effort to sell stock in his venture; the stock was begged out of his 
hands, and he merely chose those whom he wished to favor from among the 
applicants. His financial talent was called phenomenal; no one had ever 
beaten him in any transaction— he added to his incredible fortune with every 



deal he touched and every step he made, when he took the trouble to make it. 
Those who censured him most were first to seize the chance of riding on his 
talent, toward a share of his new wealth. James Taggart, Orren Boyle and 
their friends were among the heaviest stockholders of the project which 
Francisco d'Anconia had named the San Sebastian Mines. 

Dagny was never able to discover what influences prompted James Taggart to 
build a railroad branch from Texas into the wilderness of San Sebastian. It 
seemed likely that he did not know it himself: like a field without a 
windbreak, he seemed open to any current, and the final sum was made by 
chance, A few among the Directors of Taggart Transcontinental objected to the 
project. The company needed all its resources to rebuild the Rio Norte Line; 
it could not do both. But James Taggart was the road's new president. It was 
the first year of his administration. He won. 

The People's State of Mexico was eager to co-operate, and signed a 
contract guaranteeing for two hundred years the property right of Taggart 
Transcontinental to its railroad line in a country where no property rights 
existed. Francisco d'Anconia had obtained the same guaranty for his mines. 

Dagny fought against the building of the San Sebastian Line. She fought by 
means of whoever would listen to her; but she was only an assistant in the 
Operating Department, too young, without authority, and nobody listened. 

She was unable, then or since, to understand the motives of those who 
decided to build the line. Sitting as a helpless spectator, a minority 
member, at one of the Board meetings, she felt a strange evasiveness in the 
air of the room, in every speech, in every argument, as if the real reason of 
their decision were never stated, but clear to everyone except herself. 

They spoke about the future importance of the trade with Mexico, about a 
rich stream of freight, about the large revenues assured to the exclusive 
carrier of an inexhaustible supply of copper. They proved it by citing 
Francisco d'Anconia 's past achievements. They did not mention any 
mineralogical facts about the San Sebastian Mines. Few facts were available; 
the information which d'Anconia had released was not very specific; but they 
did not seem to need facts. 

They spoke at great length about the poverty of the Mexicans and their 
desperate need of railroads, "They've never had a chance." "It is our duty to 
help an underprivileged nation to develop. A country, it seems to me, is its 
neighbors ' keeper . " 

She sat, listening, and she thought of the many branch lines which Taggart 
Transcontinental had had to abandon; the revenues of the great railroad had 
been falling slowly for many years. She thought of the ominous need of 
repairs, ominously neglected over the entire system. 

Their policy on the problem of maintenance was not a policy but a game 
they seemed to be playing with a piece of rubber that could be stretched a 
little, then a little more. 

"The Mexicans, it seems to me, are a very diligent people, crushed by 
their primitive economy. How can they become industrialized if nobody lends 
them a hand?" "When considering an investment, we should, in my opinion, take 
a chance on human beings, rather than on purely material factors." 

She thought of an engine that lay in a ditch beside the Rio Norte Line, 
because a splice bar had cracked. She thought of the five days when all 
traffic was stopped on the Rio Norte Line, because a retaining wall had 
collapsed, pouring tons of rock across the track. 

"Since a man must think of the good of his brothers before he thinks of 
his own, it seems to me that a nation must think of its neighbors before it 
thinks of itself." 

She thought of a newcomer called Ellis Wyatt whom people were beginning to 
watch, because his activity was the first trickle of a torrent of goods about 
to burst from the dying stretches of Colorado. The Rio Norte Line was being 



allowed to run its way to a final collapse, just when its fullest efficiency 
was about to be needed and used. 

"Material greed isn't everything. There are non-material ideals to 
consider." "I confess to a feeling of shame when I think that we own a huge 
network of railways, while the Mexican people have nothing but one or two 
inadequate lines." "The old theory of economic self-sufficiency has been 
exploded long ago. It is impossible for one country to prosper in the midst 
of a starving world." 

She thought that to make Taggart Transcontinental what it had been once, 
long before her time, every available rail, spike and dollar was needed— and 
how desperately little of it was available. 

They spoke also, at the same session, in the same speeches, about the 
efficiency of the Mexican government that held complete control of 
everything. Mexico had a great future, they said, and would become a 
dangerous competitor in a few years. "Mexico's got discipline," the men of 
the Board kept saying, with a note of envy in their voices. 

James Taggart let it be understood— in unfinished sentences and undefined 
hints— that his friends in Washington, whom he never named, wished to see a 
railroad line built in Mexico, that such a line would be of great help in 
matters of international diplomacy, that the good will of the public opinion 
of the world would more than repay Taggart Transcontinental for its 
investment . 

They voted to build the San Sebastian Line at a cost of thirty million 
dollars . 

When Dagny left the Board room and walked through the clean, cold air of 
the streets, she heard two words repeated clearly, insistently in the numbed 
emptiness of her mind: Get out . . . Get out . . . 

Get out. 

She listened, aghast. The thought of leaving Taggart Transcontinental did 
not belong among the things she could hold as conceivable. She felt terror, 
not at the thought, but at the question of what had made her think it. She 
shook her head angrily; she told herself that Taggart Transcontinental would 
now need her more than ever. 

Two of the Directors resigned; so did the Vice-President in Charge of 
Operation. He was replaced by a friend of James Taggart, Steel rail was laid 
across the Mexican desert— while orders were issued to reduce the speed of 
trains on the Rio Norte Line, because the track was shot. A depot of 
reinforced concrete, with marble columns and mirrors, was built amidst the 
dust of an unpaved square in a Mexican village— while a train of tank cars 
carrying oil went hurtling down an embankment and into a blazing junk pile, 
because a rail had split on the Rio Norte Line. Ellis Wyatt did not wait for 
the court to decide whether the accident was an act of God, as James Taggart 
claimed, He transferred the shipping of his oil to the Phoenix-Durango, an 
obscure railroad which was small and struggling, but struggling well. 

This was the rocket that sent the Phoenix-Durango on its way. From then 
on, it grew, as Wyatt Oil grew, as factories grew in nearby valleys —as a 
band of rails and ties grew, at the rate of two miles a month, across the 
scraggly fields of Mexican corn. 

Dagny was thirty-two years old, when she told James Taggart that she would 
resign. She had run the Operating Department for the past three years, 
without title, credit or authority. She was defeated by loathing for the 
hours, the days, the nights she had to waste circumventing the interference 
of Jim's friend who bore the title of Vice-President in Charge of Operation. 
The man had no policy, and any decision he made was always hers, but he made 
it only after he had made every effort to make it impossible. What she 
delivered to her brother was an ultimatum. He gasped, "But, Dagny, you're a 



woman! A woman as Operating Vice-President? It's unheard of! The Board won't 
consider it!" "Then I'm through," she answered. 

She did not think of what she would do with the rest of her life. To face 
leaving Taggart Transcontinental was like waiting to have her legs amputated; 
she thought she would let it happen, then take up the load of whatever was 
left. 

She never understood why the Board of Directors voted unanimously to make 
her Vice-President in Charge of Operation. 

It was she who finally gave them their San Sebastian Line. When she took 
over, the construction had been under way for three years; one third of its 
track was laid; the cost to date was beyond the authorized total. She fired 
Jim's friends and found a contractor who completed the job in one year. 

The San Sebastian Line was now in operation. No surge of trade had come 
across the border, nor any trains loaded with copper. A few carloads came 
clattering down the mountains from San Sebastian, at long intervals. The 
mines, said Francisco d'Anconia, were still in the process of development. 
The drain on Taggart Transcontinental had not stopped. 

Now she sat at the desk in her office, as she had sat for many evenings, 
trying to work out the problem of what branches could save the system and in 
how many years . 

The Rio Norte Line, when rebuilt, would redeem the rest. As she looked at 
the sheets of figures announcing losses and more losses, she did not think of 
the long, senseless agony of the Mexican venture. She thought of a telephone 
call. "Hank, can you save us? Can you give us rail on the shortest notice and 
the longest credit possible?" A quiet, steady voice had answered, "Sure." 

The thought was a point of support. She leaned over the sheets of paper on 
her desk, finding it suddenly easier to concentrate. There was one thing, at 
least, that could be counted upon not to crumble when needed. 

James Taggart crossed the anteroom of Dagny's office, still holding the 
kind of confidence he had felt among his companions at the barroom half an 
hour ago. When he opened her door, the confidence vanished. He crossed the 
room to her desk like a child being dragged to punishment, storing the 
resentment for all his future years. 

He saw a head bent over sheets of paper, the light of the desk lamp 
glistening on strands of disheveled hair, a white shirt clinging to her 
shoulders, its loose folds suggesting the thinness of her body. 

"What is it, Jim?" 

"What are you trying to pull on the San Sebastian Line?" 
She raised her head. "Pull? Why?" 

"What sort of schedule are we running down there and what kind of trains?" 
She laughed; the sound was gay and a little weary. "You really ought to 
read the reports sent to the president's office, Jim, once in a while." 
"What do you mean?" 

"We've been running that schedule and those trains on the San Sebastian 
for the last three months." 

"One passenger train a day?" 

"—in the morning. And one freight train every other night." 

"Good God! On an important branch like that?" 

"The important branch can't pay even for those two trams." 

"But the Mexican people expect real service from us ! " 

"I'm sure they do." 

"They need trains ! " 

"For what?" 

"For ... To help them develop local industries. How do you expect them 
to develop if we don't give them transportation?" 
"I don't expect them to develop," 



"That's just your personal opinion. I don't see what right you had to take 
it upon yourself to cut our schedules. Why, the copper traffic alone will pay 
for everything." 

"When?" 

He looked at her; his face assumed the satisfaction of a person about to 
utter something that has the power to hurt. "You don't doubt the success of 
those copper mines, do you?— when it's Francisco d'Anconia who's running 
them?" He stressed the name, watching her. 

She said, "He may be your friend, but—" 

"My friend? I thought he was yours." 

She said steadily, "Not for the last ten years." 

"That's too bad, isn't it? Still, he's one of the smartest operators on 
earth. He's never failed in a venture— I mean, a business venture— and he's 
sunk millions of his own money into those mines, so we can rely on his 
judgment . " 

"When will you realize that Francisco d'Anconia has turned into a 
worthless bum?" 

He chuckled. "I always thought that that's what he was— as far as his 
personal character is concerned. But you didn't share my opinion. Yours was 
opposite. Oh my, how opposite! Surely you remember our quarrels on the 
subject? Shall I quote some of the things you said about him? I can only 
surmise as to some of the things you did." 

"Do you wish to discuss Francisco d'Anconia? Is that what you came here 
for?" 

His face showed the anger of failure— because hers showed nothing. 
"You know damn well what I came here for!" he snapped. "I've heard some 
incredible things about our trains in Mexico." 
"What things?" 

"What sort of rolling stock are you using down there?" 
"The worst I could find." 
"You admit that?" 

"I've stated it on paper in the reports I sent you." 
"Is it true that you're using wood-burning locomotives?" 
"Eddie found them for me in somebody's abandoned roundhouse down in 
Louisiana. He couldn't even learn the name of the railroad." 
"And that's what you're running as Taggart trains?" 
"Yes . " 

"What in hell's the big idea? What's going on? I want to know what's going 
on!" 

She spoke evenly, looking straight at him. "If you want to know, I have 
left nothing but junk on the San Sebastian Line, and as little of that as 
possible. I have moved everything that could be moved— switch engines, shop 
tools, even typewriters and mirrors— out of Mexico." 

"Why in blazes?" 

"So that the looters won't have too much to loot when they nationalize the 
line. " 

He leaped to his feet. "You won't get away with that! This is one time you 
won't get away with it! To have the nerve to pull such a low, unspeakable . . 
. just because of some vicious rumors, when we have a contract for two 
hundred years and . . . " 

"Jim," she said slowly, "there's not a car, engine or ton of coal that we 
can spare anywhere on the system." 

"I won't permit it, I absolutely won't permit such an outrageous policy 
toward a friendly people who need our help. Material greed isn't everything. 
After all, there are non-material considerations, even though you wouldn't 
understand them!" 

She pulled a pad forward and picked up a pencil. "All right, Jim. 



How many trains do you wish me to run on the San Sebastian Line?" 
"Huh?" 

"Which runs do you wish me to cut and on which of our lines— in order to 
get the Diesels and the steel coaches?" 
"I don't want you to cut any runs!" 
"Then where do I get the equipment for Mexico?" 
"That's for you to figure out. It's your job." 
"I am not able to do it. You will have to decide." 

"That's your usual rotten trick— switching the responsibility to me!" 

"I'm waiting for orders, Jim." 

' Tm not going to let you trap me like that!" 

She dropped the pencil. "Then the San Sebastian schedule will remain as it 
is . " 

"Just wait till the Board meeting next month. I'll demand a decision, Once 
and for all, on how far the Operating Department is to be permitted to exceed 
its authority. You're going to have to answer for this." 

"Ill answer for it." 

She was back at her work before the door had closed on James Taggart. 

When she finished, pushed the papers aside and glanced up, the sky was 
black beyond the window, and the city had become a glowing spread of lighted 
glass without masonry. She rose reluctantly. She resented the small defeat of 
being tired, but she knew that she was, tonight. 

The outer office was dark and empty; her staff had gone. Only Eddie 
Willers was still there, at his desk in his glass-partitioned enclosure that 
looked like a cube of light in a comer of the large room. She waved to him on 
her way out. 

She did not take the elevator to the lobby of the building, but to the 
concourse of the Taggart Terminal. She liked to walk through it on her way 
home . 

She had always felt that the concourse looked like a temple. Glancing up 
at the distant ceiling, she saw dim vaults supported by giant granite 
columns, and the tops of vast windows glazed by darkness. The vaulting held 
the solemn peace of a cathedral, spread in protection high above the rushing 
activity of men. 

Dominating the concourse, but ignored by the travelers as a habitual 
sight, stood a statue of Nathaniel Taggart, the founder of the railroad. 

Dagny was the only one who remained aware of it and had never been able to 
take it for granted. To look at that statue whenever she crossed the 
concourse, was the only form of prayer she knew. 

Nathaniel Taggart had been a penniless adventurer who had come from 
somewhere in New England and built a railroad across a continent, in the days 
of the first steel rails. His railroad still stood; his battle to build it 
had dissolved into a legend, because people preferred not to Understand it or 
to believe it possible. 

He was a man who had never accepted the creed that others had the right to 
stop him. He set his goal and moved toward it, his way as straight as one of 
his rails. He never sought any loans, bonds, subsidies, land grants or 
legislative favors from the government. He obtained money from the men who 
owned it, going from door to door— 

from the mahogany doors of bankers to the clapboard doors of lonely 
farmhouses. He never talked about the public good. He merely told people that 
they would make big profits on his railroad, he told them why he expected the 
profits and he gave his reasons. He had good reasons. 

Through all the generations that followed, Taggart Transcontinental was 
one of the few railroads that never went bankrupt and the only one whose 
controlling stock remained in the hands of the founder's descendants. 



In his lifetime, the name "Nat Taggart" was not famous, but notorious; it 
was repeated, not in homage, but in resentful curiosity; and if anyone 
admired him, it was as one admires a successful bandit. Yet no penny of his 
wealth had been obtained by force or fraud; he was guilty of nothing, except 
that he earned his own fortune and never forgot that it was his. 

Many stories were whispered about him. It was said that in the wilderness 
of the Middle West, he murdered a state legislator who attempted to revoke a 
charter granted to him, to revoke it when his rail was laid halfway across 
the state; some legislators had planned to make a fortune on Taggart stock— by 
selling it short. Nat Taggart was indicted for the murder, but the charge 
could never be proved. He had no trouble with legislators from then on. 

It was said that Nat Taggart had staked his life on his railroad many 
times; but once, he staked more than his life. Desperate for funds, with the 
construction of his line suspended, he threw down three flights of stairs a 
distinguished gentleman who offered him a loan from the government. Then he 
pledged his wife as security for a loan from a millionaire who hated him and 
admired her beauty. He repaid the loan on time and did not have to surrender 
his pledge. The deal had been made with his wife's consent. She was a great 
beauty from the noblest family of a southern state, and she had been 
disinherited by her family because she eloped with Nat Taggart when he was 
only a ragged young adventurer. 

Dagny regretted at times that Nat Taggart was her ancestor. What she felt 
for him did not belong in the category of unchosen family affections. She did 
not want her feeling to be the thing one was supposed to owe an uncle or a 
grandfather. She was incapable of love for any object not of her own choice 
and she resented anyone's demand for it. But had it been possible to choose 
an ancestor, she would have chosen Nat Taggart, in voluntary homage and with 
all of her gratitude. 

Nat Taggart ' s statue was copied from an artist's sketch of him, the only 
record ever made of his appearance. He had lived far into old age, but one 
could never think of him except as he was on that sketch —as a young man. In 
her childhood, his statue had been Dagny 's first concept of the exalted. When 
she was sent to church or to school, and heard people using that word, she 
thought that she knew what they meant: she thought of the statue. 

The statue was of a young man with a tall, gaunt body and an angular face. 
He held his head as if he faced a challenge and found joy in his capacity to 
meet it. All that Dagny wanted of life was contained in the desire to hold 
her head as he did. 

Tonight, she looked at the statue when she walked across the concourse. It 
was a moment's rest; it was as if a burden she could not name were lightened 
and as if a faint current of air were touching her forehead. 

In a corner of the concourse, by the main entrance, there was a small 
newsstand. The owner, a quiet, courteous old man with an air of breeding, had 
stood behind his counter for twenty years. He had owned a cigarette factory 
once, but it had gone bankrupt, and he had resigned himself to the lonely 
obscurity of his little stand in the midst of an eternal whirlpool of 
strangers. He had no family or friends left alive. 

He had a hobby which was his only pleasure: he gathered cigarettes from 
all over the world for his private collection; he knew every brand made or 
that had ever been made. 

Dagny liked to stop at his newsstand on her way out. He seemed to be part 
of the Taggart Terminal, like an old watchdog too feeble to protect it, but 
reassuring by the loyalty of his presence. He liked to see her coming, 
because it amused him to think that he alone knew the importance of the young 
woman in a sports coat and a slanting hat, who came hurrying anonymously 
through the crowd. 



She stopped tonight, as usual, to buy a package of cigarettes. "How is the 
collection?" she asked him. "Any new specimens?" 

He smiled sadly, shaking his head. "No, Miss Taggart. There aren't any new 
brands made anywhere in the world. Even the old ones are going, one after 
another. There's only five or six kinds left selling now. 

There used to be dozens. People aren't making anything new any more." 

"They will. That's only temporary." 

He glanced at her and did not answer. Then he said, "I like cigarettes, 
Miss Taggart. I like to think of fire held in a man's hand. Fire, a dangerous 
force, tamed at his fingertips. I often wonder about the hours when a man 
sits alone, watching the smoke of a cigarette, thinking. I wonder what great 
things have come from such hours. When a man thinks, there is a spot of fire 
alive in his mind— and it is proper that he should have the burning point of a 
cigarette as his one expression." 

"Do they ever think?" she asked involuntarily, and stopped; the question 
was her one personal torture and she did not want to discuss it. 

The old man looked as if he had noticed the sudden stop and understood it; 
but he did not start discussing it; he said, instead, "I don't like the thing 
that's happening to people, Miss Taggart." 

"What?" 

"I don't know. But I've watched them here for twenty years and I've seen 
the change. They used to rush through here, and it was wonderful to watch, it 
was the hurry of men who knew where they were going and were eager to get 
there. Now they're hurrying because they are afraid. 

It's not a purpose that drives them, it's fear. They're not going 
anywhere, they're escaping. And I don't think they know what it is that they 
want to escape. They don't look at one another. They jerk when brushed 
against. They smile too much, but it's an ugly kind of smiling: it's not joy, 
it's pleading. I don't know what it is that's happening to the world." He 
shrugged. "Oh well, who is John Gait?" 

"He's just a meaningless phrase!" 

She was startled by the sharpness of her own voice, and she added in 
apology, "I don't like that empty piece of slang. What does it mean? 
Where did it come from?" 
"Nobody knows," he answered slowly. 

"Why do people keep saying it? Nobody seems able to explain just what it 
stands for, yet they all use it as if they knew the meaning." 
"Why does it disturb you?" he asked. 

"I don't like what they seem to mean when they say it." 
"I don't, either, Miss Taggart." 

Eddie Willers ate his dinners in the employees' cafeteria of the Taggart 
Terminal. There was a restaurant in the building, patronized by Taggart 
executives, but he did not like it. The cafeteria seemed part of the 
railroad, and he felt more at home. 

The cafeteria lay underground. It was a large room with walls of white 
tile that glittered in the reflections of electric lights and looked like 
silver brocade. It had a high ceiling, sparkling counters of glass and 
chromium, a sense of space and light. 

There was a railroad worker whom Eddie Willers met at times in the 
cafeteria. Eddie liked his face. They had been drawn into a chance 
conversation once, and then it became their habit to dine together whenever 
they happened to meet. 

Eddie had forgotten whether he had ever asked the worker's name or the 
nature of his job; he supposed that the job wasn't much, because the man's 
clothes were rough and grease-stained. The man was not a person to him, but 
only a silent presence with an enormous intensity of interest in the one 
thing which was the meaning of his own life: in Taggart Transcontinental. 



Tonight, coming down late, Eddie saw the worker at a table in a corner of 
the half -deserted room. Eddie smiled happily, waving to him, and carried his 
tray of food to the worker's table. 

In the privacy of their corner, Eddie felt at ease, relaxing after the 
long strain of the day. He could talk as he did not talk anywhere else, 
admitting things he would not confess to anyone, thinking aloud, looking into 
the attentive eyes of the worker across the table. 

"The Rio Norte Line is our last hope," said Eddie Willers. "But it will 
save us. We'll have at least one branch in good condition, where it's needed 
most, and that will help to save the rest. . . . It's funny— 

isn't it?— to speak about a last hope for Taggart Transcontinental. Do you 
take it seriously if somebody tells you that a meteor is going to destroy the 
earth? ... I don't, either. . . . 'From Ocean to Ocean, f orever ' — that ' s 
what we heard all through our childhood, she and I. 

No, they didn't say 'forever, ' but that's what it meant. . . . You know, 
I'm not any kind of a great man. I couldn't have built that railroad. If it 
goes, I won't be able to bring it back. I'll have to go with it. . . . 

Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know why I should want to say 
things like that. Guess I'm just a little tired tonight. . . . Yes, I worked 
late. She didn't ask me to stay, but there was a light under her door, long 
after all the others had gone . . . Yes, she's gone home now. . . . 

Trouble? Oh, there's always trouble in the office. But she's not worried. 

She knows she can pull us through. ... Of course, it's bad. We're having 
many more accidents than you hear about. We lost two Diesels again, last 
week. One— just from old age, the other— in a head-on collision. . . . Yes, we 
have Diesels on order, at the United Locomotive Works, but we've waited for 
them for two years. I don't know whether we'll ever get them or not. . . . 
God, do we need them! Motive power —you can't imagine how important that is. 
That's the heart of everything. . . . What are you smiling at? . . . Well, as 
I was saying, it's bad. But at least the Rio Norte Line is set. The first 
shipment of rail will get to the site in a few weeks. In a year, we'll run 
the first train on the new track. Nothing's going to stop us, this time. . . 
. Sure, I know who's going to lay the rail. McNamara, of Cleveland. He's the 
contractor who finished the San Sebastian Line for us. There, at least, is 
one man who knows his job. So we're safe. We can count on him. There aren't 
many good contractors left. . . . We're rushed as hell, but I like it. I've 
been coming to the office an hour earlier than usual, but she beats me to it. 
She's always there first. . . . What? ... I don't know what she does at 
night. Nothing much, I guess. . . . No, she never goes out with anyone. She 
sits at home, mostly, and listens to music. She plays records. . . . What do 
you care, which records? Richard Halley. 

She loves the music of Richard Halley. Outside the railroad, that's the 
only thing she loves." 



CHAPTER IV 
THE IMMOVABLE MOVERS 



Motive power— thought Dagny, looking up at the Taggart Building in the 
twilight— was its first need; motive power, to keep that building standing; 
movement, to keep it immovable. It did not rest on piles driven into granite 
it rested on the engines that rolled across a continent. 

She felt a dim touch of anxiety. She was back from a trip to the plant of 
the United Locomotive Works in New Jersey, where she had gone to see the 
president of the company in person. She had learned nothing: neither the 
reason for the delays nor any indication of the date when the Diesel engines 
would be produced. The president of the company had talked to her for two 
hours. But none of his answers had connected to any of her questions. His 
manner had conveyed a peculiar note of condescending reproach whenever she 
attempted to make the conversation specific, as if she were giving proof of 
ill-breeding by breaking some unwritten code known to everyone else. 

On her way through the plant, she had seen an enormous piece of machinery 
left abandoned in a corner of the yard. It had been a precision machine tool 
once, long ago, of a kind that could not be bought anywhere now. It had not 
been worn out; it had been rotted by neglect, eaten by rust and the black 
drippings of a dirty oil. She had turned her face away from it. A sight of 
that nature always blinded her for an instant by the burst of too violent an 
anger. She did not know why; she could not define her own feeling; she knew 
only that there was, in her feeling, a scream of protest against injustice, 
and that it was a response to something much beyond an old piece of 
machinery . 

The rest of her staff had gone, when she entered the anteroom of her 
office, but Eddie Willers was still there, waiting for her. She knew at once 
that something had happened, by the way he looked and the way he followed he 
silently into her office. 

"What's the matter, Eddie?" 

"McNamara quit." 

She looked at him blankly. "What do you mean, quit?" 
"Left. Retired. Went out of business." 
"McNamara, our contractor?" 
"Yes" 

"But that's impossible!" 
"I know it." 
"What happened? Why?" 
"Nobody knows . " 

Taking her time deliberately, she unbuttoned her coat, sat down at her 
desk, started to pull off her gloves. Then she said, "Begin at the beginning 
Eddie. Sit down." 

He spoke quietly, but he remained standing. "I talked to his chief 
engineer, long distance. The chief engineer called from Cleveland, to tell 
us. That's all he said. He knew nothing else." 

"What did he say?" 

"That McNamara has closed his business and gone." 
"Where?" 

"He doesn't know. Nobody knows." 

She noticed that she was holding with one hand two empty fingers of the 
glove of the other, the glove half-removed and forgotten. She pulled it off 
and dropped it on the desk. 

Eddie said, "He's walked out on a pile of contracts that are worth a 
fortune. He had a waiting list of clients for the next three years. . . ." 



She said nothing. He added, his voice low, "I wouldn't be frightened if I 
could understand it. . . . But a thing that can't have any possible reason . 
. ." She remained silent. "He was the best contractor in the country." 

They looked at each other. What she wanted to say was, "Oh God, Eddie!" 
Instead, her voice even, she said, "Don't worry. We'll find another 
contractor for the Rio Norte Line, " 

It was late when she left her office. Outside, on the sidewalk at the door 
of the building, she paused, looking at the streets. She felt suddenly empty 
of energy, of purpose, of desire, as if a motor had crackled and stopped. 

A faint glow streamed from behind the buildings into the sky, the 
reflection of thousands of unknown lights, the electric breath of the city. 

She wanted to rest. To rest, she thought, and to find enjoyment somewhere. 

Her work was all she had or wanted. But there were times, like tonight, 
when she felt that sudden, peculiar emptiness, which was not emptiness, but 
silence, not despair, but immobility, as if nothing within her were 
destroyed, but everything stood still. Then she felt the wish to find a 
moment's joy outside, the wish to be held as a passive spectator by some work 
or sight of greatness. Not to make it, she thought, but to accept; not to 
begin, but to respond; not to create, but to admire. I need it to let me go 
on, she thought, because joy is one's fuel. 

She had always been— she closed her eyes with a faint smile of amusement 
and pain— the motive power of her own happiness. For once, she wanted to feel 
herself carried by the power of someone else's achievement. As men on a dark 
prairie liked to see the lighted windows of a train going past, her 
achievement, the sight of power and purpose that gave them reassurance in the 
midst of empty miles and night —so she wanted to feel it for a moment, a 
brief greeting, a single glimpse, just to wave her arm and say: Someone is 
going somewhere. . . . 

She started walking slowly, her hands in the pockets of her coat, the 
shadow of her slanting hat brim across her face. The buildings around her 
rose to such heights that her glance could not find the sky. She thought: It 
has taken so much to build this city, it should have so much to offer. 

Above the door of a shop, the black hole of a radio loudspeaker was 
hurling sounds at the streets. They were the sounds of a symphony concert 
being given somewhere in the city. They were a long screech without shape, as 
of cloth and flesh being torn at random. They scattered with no melody, no 
harmony, no rhythm to hold them. If music was emotion and emotion came from 
thought, then this was the scream of chaos, of the irrational, of the 
helpless, of man's self-abdication. 

She walked on. She stopped at the window of a bookstore. The window 
displayed a pyramid of slabs in brownish-purple jackets, inscribed: The 
Vulture Is Molting. "The novel of our century," said a placard. 

"The penetrating study of a businessman's greed. A fearless revelation of 
man's depravity." 

She walked past a movie theater. Its lights wiped out half a block, 
leaving only a huge photograph and some letters suspended in blazing mid-air. 
The photograph was of a smiling young woman; looking at her face, one felt 
the weariness of having seen it for years, even while seeing it for the first 
time. The letters said: ". . . in a momentous drama giving the answer to the 
great problem: Should a woman tell?" 

She walked past the door of a night club. A couple came staggering out to 
a taxicab. The girl had blurred eyes, a perspiring face, an ermine cape and a 
beautiful evening gown that had slipped off one shoulder like a slovenly 
housewife's bathrobe, revealing too much of her breast, not in a manner of 
daring, but in the manner of a drudge's indifference. Her escort steered her, 
gripping her naked arm; his face did not have the expression of a man 



anticipating a romantic adventure, but the sly look of a boy out to write 
obscenities on fences. 

What had she hoped to find?— she thought, walking on. These were the things 
men lived by, the forms of their spirit, of their culture, of their 
enjoyment. She had seen nothing else anywhere, not for many years. 

At the corner of the street where she lived, she bought a newspaper and 
went home . 

Her apartment was two rooms on the top floor of a skyscraper. The sheets 
of glass in the corner window of her living room made it look like the prow 
of a ship in motion, and the lights of the city were like phosphorescent 
sparks on the black waves of steel and stone. When she turned on a lamp, long 
triangles of shadow cut the bare walls, in a geometrical pattern of light 
rays broken by a few angular pieces of furniture. 

She stood in the middle of the room, alone between sky and city. 

There was only one thing that could give her the feeling she wanted to 
experience tonight; it was the only form of enjoyment she had found. 

She turned to a phonograph and put on a record of the music of Richard 
Halley. 

It was his Fourth Concerto, the last work he had written. The crash of its 
opening chords swept the sights of the streets away from her mind. 

The Concerto was a great cry of rebellion. It was a "No" flung at some 
vast process of torture, a denial of suffering, a denial that held the agony 
of the struggle to break free. The sounds were like a voice saying: There is 
no necessity for pain— why, then, is the worst pain reserved for those who 
will not accept its necessity?— we who hold the love and the secret of joy, to 
what punishment have we been sentenced for it, and by whom? . . . The sounds 
of torture became defiance, the statement of agony became a hymn to a distant 
vision for whose sake anything was worth enduring, even this. It was the song 
of rebellion— and of a desperate quest. 

She sat still, her eyes closed, listening. 

No one knew what had happened to Richard Halley, or why. The story of his 
life had been like a summary written to damn greatness by showing the price 
one pays for it. It had been a procession of years spent in garrets and 
basements, years that had taken the gray tinge of the walls imprisoning a man 
whose music overflowed with violent color. 

It had been the gray of a struggle against long flights of unlighted 
tenement stairs, against frozen plumbing, against the price of a sandwich in 
an ill-smelling delicatessen store, against the faces of men who listened to 
music, their eyes empty. It had been a struggle without the relief of 
violence, without the recognition of finding a conscious enemy, with only a 
deaf wall to batter, a wall of the most effective soundproofing: 
indifference, that swallowed blows, chords and screams— a battle of silence, 
for a man who could give to sounds a greater eloquence than they had ever 
carried— the silence of obscurity, of loneliness, of the nights when some rare 
orchestra played one of his works and he looked at the darkness, knowing that 
his soul went in trembling, widening circles from a radio tower through the 
air of the city, but there were no receivers tuned to hear it. 

"The music of Richard Halley has a quality of the heroic. Our age has 
outgrown that stuff," said one critic. "The music of Richard Halley is out of 
key with our times. It has a tone of ecstasy. Who cares for ecstasy 
nowadays?" said another. 

His life had been a summary of the lives of all the men whose reward is a 
monument in a public park a hundred years after the time when a reward can 
matter— except that Richard Halley did not die soon enough. He lived to see 
the night which, by the accepted laws of history, he was not supposed to see. 
He was forty-three years old and it was the opening night of Phaethon, an 
opera he had written at the age of twenty-four. He had changed the ancient 



Greek myth to his own purpose and meaning: Phaethon, the young son of Helios, 
who stole his father's chariot and, in ambitious audacity, attempted to drive 
the sun across the sky, did not perish, as he perished in the myth; in 
Halley's opera, Phaethon succeeded. The opera had been performed then, 
nineteen years ago, and had closed after one performance, to the sound of 
booing and catcalls. That night, Richard Halley had walked the streets of the 
city till dawn, trying to find an answer to a question, which he did not 
find. 

On the night when the opera was presented again, nineteen years later, the 
last sounds of the music crashed into the sounds of the greatest ovation the 
opera house had ever heard. The ancient walls could not contain it, the 
sounds of cheering burst through to the lobbies, to the stairs, to the 
streets, to the boy who had walked those streets nineteen years ago. 

Dagny was in the audience on the night of the ovation. She was one of the 
few who had known the music of Richard Halley much earlier; but she had never 
seen him. She saw him being pushed out on the stage, saw him facing the 
enormous spread of waving arms and cheering heads. He stood without moving, a 
tall, emaciated man with graying hair. He did not bow, did not smile; he just 
stood there, looking at the crowd. His face had the quiet, earnest look of a 
man staring at a question. 

"The music of Richard Halley, " wrote a critic next morning, "belongs to 
mankind. It is the product and the expression of the greatness of the 
people." "There is an inspiring lesson," said a minister, "in the life of 
Richard Halley. He has had a terrible struggle, but what does that matter? It 
is proper, it is noble that he should have endured suffering, injustice, 
abuse at the hands of his brothers— in order to enrich their lives and teach 
them to appreciate the beauty of great music." 

On the day after the opening, Richard Halley retired. 

He gave no explanation. He merely told his publishers that his career was 
over. He sold them the rights to his works for a modest sum, even though he 
knew that his royalties would now bring him a fortune. He went away, leaving 
no address. It was eight years ago; no one had seen him since. 

Dagny listened to the Fourth Concerto, her head thrown back, her eyes 
closed. She lay half-stretched across the corner of a couch, her body relaxed 
and still; but tension stressed the shape of her mouth on her motionless 
face, a sensual shape drawn in lines of longing. 

After a while, she opened her eyes. She noticed the newspaper she had 
thrown down on the couch. She reached for it absently, to turn the vapid 
headlines out of sight. The paper fell open. She saw the photograph of a face 
she knew, and the heading of a story. She slammed the pages shut and flung 
them aside. 

It was the face of Francisco d'Anconia. The heading said that he had 
arrived in New York. What of it?— she thought. She would not have to see him. 
She had not seen him for years. 

She sat looking down at the newspaper on the floor. Don't read it, she 
thought; don't look at it. But the face, she thought, had not changed. 

How could a face remain the same when everything else was gone? She wished 
they had not caught a picture of him when he smiled. That kind of smile did 
not belong in the pages of a newspaper. It was the smile of a man who is able 
to see, to know and to create the glory of existence. It was the mocking, 
challenging smile of a brilliant intelligence. 

Don't read it, she thought; not now— not to that music— oh, not to that 
music ! 

She reached for the paper and opened it. 

The story said that Senor Francisco d'Anconia had granted an interview to 
the press in his suite at the Wayne-Falkland Hotel. He said that he had come 
to New York for two important reasons: a hat-check girl at the Cub Club, and 



the liverwurst at Moe ' s Delicatessen on Third Avenue. He had nothing to say 
about the coming divorce trial of Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert Vail. Mrs. Vail, a 
lady of noble breeding and unusual loveliness, had taken a shot at her 
distinguished young husband, some months ago, publicly declaring that she 
wished to get rid of him for the sake of her lover, Francisco d'Anconia. She 
had given to the press a detailed account of her secret romance, including a 
description of the night of last New Year's Eve which she had spent at 
d'Anconia 's villa in the Andes. Her husband had survived the shot and had 
sued for divorce. 

She had countered with a suit for half of her husband's millions, and with 
a recital of his private life which, she said, made hers look innocent. 

All of that had been splashed over the newspapers for weeks. But Senor 
d'Anconia had nothing to say about it, when the reporters questioned him. 
Would he deny Mrs. Vail's story, they asked. "I never deny anything," he 
answered. The reporters had been astonished by his sudden arrival in town; 
they had thought that he would not wish to be there just when the worst of 
the scandal was about to explode on the front pages. But they had been wrong. 
Francisco d'Anconia added one more comment to the reasons for his arrival. "I 
wanted to witness the farce, " 

he said. 

Dagny let the paper slip to the floor. She sat, bent over, her head on her 
arms. She did not move, but the strands of hair, hanging down to her knees, 
trembled in sudden jolts once in a while. 

The great chords of Halley's music went on, filling the room, piercing the 
glass of the windows, streaming out over the city. She was hearing the music. 
It was her quest, her cry. 

James Taggart glanced about the living room of his apartment, wondering 
what time it was; he did not feel like moving to find his watch. 

He sat in an armchair, dressed in wrinkled pajamas, barefooted; it was too 
much trouble to look for his slippers. The light of the gray sky in the 
windows hurt his eyes, still sticky with sleep. He felt, inside his skull, 
the nasty heaviness which is about to become a headache. He wondered angrily 
why he had stumbled out into the living room. Oh yes, he remembered, to look 
for the time. 

He slumped sidewise over the arm of the chair and caught sight of a clock 
on a distant building: it was twenty minutes past noon. 

Through the open door of the bedroom, he heard Betty Pope washing her 
teeth in the bathroom beyond. Her girdle lay on the floor, by the side of a 
chair with the rest of her clothes; the girdle was a faded pink, with broken 
strands of rubber. 

"Hurry up, will you?" he called irritably. "I've got to dress," 

She did not answer. She had left the door of the bathroom open; he could 
hear the sound of gargling. 

Why do I do those things?— he thought, remembering last night. But it was 
too much trouble to look for an answer. 

Betty Pope came into the living room, dragging the folds of a satin 
negligee harlequin-checkered in orange and purple. She looked awful in a 
negligee, thought Taggart; she was ever so much better in a riding habit, in 
the photographs on the society pages of the newspapers. She was a lanky girl, 
all bones and loose joints that did not move smoothly. 

She had a homely face, a bad complexion and a look of impertinent 
condescension derived from the fact that she belonged to one of the very best 
families . 

"Aw, hell!" she said at nothing in particular, stretching herself to 
limber up. "Jim, where are your nail clippers? I've got to trim my toenails." 
"I don't know. I have a headache. Do it at home." 



"You look unappetizing in the morning." she said indifferently. "You look 
like a snail . " 

"Why don't you shut up?" 

She wandered aimlessly about the room. "I don't want to go home," 

she said with no particular feeling. "I hate morning. Here's another day 
and nothing to do. I've got a tea session on for this afternoon, at Liz 
Blane's. Oh well, it might be fun, because Liz is a bitch." She picked up a 
glass and swallowed the stale remnant of a drink. "Why don't you have them 
repair your air-conditioner? This place smells." 

"Are you through in the bathroom?" he asked. "I have to dress. I have an 
important engagement today." 

"Go right in. I don't mind. I'll share the bathroom with you. I hate to be 
rushed . " 

While he shaved, he saw her dressing in front of the open bathroom door. 
She took a long time twisting herself into her girdle, hooking garters to her 
stockings, pulling on an ungainly, expensive tweed suit. 

The harlequin negligee, picked from an advertisement in the smartest 
fashion magazine, was like a uniform which she knew to be expected on certain 
occasions, which she had worn dutifully for a specified purpose and then 
discarded . 

The nature of their relationship had the same quality. There was no 
passion in it, no desire, no actual pleasure, not even a sense of shame. 

To them, the act of sex was neither joy nor sin. It meant nothing. They 
had heard that men and women were supposed to sleep together, so they did. 

"Jim, why don't you take me to the Armenian restaurant tonight?" 

she asked. "I love shish-kebab . " 

"I can't," he answered angrily through the soap lather on his face. 
"I've got a busy day ahead." 
"Why don't you cancel it?" 
"What?" 

"Whatever it is." 

"It is very important, my dear. It is a meeting of our Board of 
Directors . " 

"Oh, don't be stuffy about your damn railroad. It's boring. I hate 
businessmen. They're dull." 
He did not answer. 

She glanced at him slyly, and her voice acquired a livelier note when she 
drawled, "Jock Benson said that you have a soft snap on that railroad anyway, 
because it's your sister who runs the whole works." 

"Oh, he did, did he?" 

"I think that your sister is awful. I think it's disgusting— a woman acting 
like a grease-monkey and posing around like a big executive. It's so 
unfeminine. Who does she think she is, anyway?" 

Taggart stepped out to the threshold. He leaned against the doorjamb, 
studying Betty Pope. There was a faint smile on his face, sarcastic and 
confident. They had, he thought, a bond in common. 

"It might interest you to know, my dear," he said, "that I'm putting the 
skids under my sister this afternoon." 

"No?" she said, interested. "Really?" 

"And that is why this Board meeting is so important." 
"Are you really going to kick her out?" 

"No. That's not necessary or advisable. I shall merely put her in her 
place. It's the chance I've been waiting for." 
"You got something on her? Some scandal?" 

"No, no. You wouldn't understand. It's merely that she's gone too far, for 
once, and she's going to get slapped down. She's pulled an inexcusable sort 
of stunt, without consulting anybody. It's a serious offense against our 



Mexican neighbors. When the Board hears about it, they'll pass a couple of 
new rulings on the Operating Department, which will make my sister a little 
easier to manage." 

"You're smart, Jim," she said. 

"I'd better get dressed." He sounded pleased. He turned back to the 
washbowl, adding cheerfully, "Maybe I will take you out tonight and buy you 
some shish-kebab . " 

The telephone rang. 

He lifted the receiver. The operator announced a long-distance call from 
Mexico City. 

The hysterical voice that came on the wire was that of his political man 
in Mexico. 

"I couldn't help it, Jim!" it gulped. "I couldn't help it! . . . We had no 
warning, I swear to God, nobody suspected, nobody saw it coming, I've done my 
best, you can't blame me, Jim, it was a bolt out of the blue! The decree came 
out this morning, just five minutes ago, they sprang it on us like that, 
without any notice! The government of the People's State of Mexico has 
nationalized the San Sebastian Mines and the San Sebastian Railroad." 

". . . and, therefore, I can assure the gentlemen of the Board that there 
is no occasion for panic. The event of this morning is a regrettable 
development, but I have full confidence— based on my knowledge of the inner 
processes shaping our foreign policy in Washington— that our government will 
negotiate an equitable settlement with the government of the People's State 
of Mexico, and that we will receive full and just compensation for our 
property . " 

James Taggart stood at the long table, addressing the Board of Directors. 
His voice was precise and monotonous; it connoted safety. 

"I am glad to report, however, that I foresaw the possibility of such a 
turn of events and took every precaution to protect the interests of Taggart 
Transcontinental. Some months ago, I instructed our Operating Department to 
cut the schedule on the San Sebastian Line down to a single train a day, and 
to remove from it our best motive power and rolling stock, as well as every 
piece of equipment that could be moved. 

The Mexican government was able to seize nothing but a few wooden cars and 
one superannuated locomotive. My decision has saved the company many millions 
of dollars— I shall have the exact figures computed and submit them to you. I 
do feel, however, that our stockholders will be justified in expecting that 
those who bore the major responsibility for this venture should now bear the 
consequences of their negligence. I would suggest, therefore, that we request 
the resignation of Mr. Clarence Eddington, our economic consultant, who 
recommended the construction of the San Sebastian Line, and of Mr. Jules 
Mott, our representative in Mexico City." 

The men sat around the long table, listening. They did not think of what 
they would have to do, but of what they would have to say to the men they 
represented. Taggart ' s speech gave them what they needed. 

Orren Boyle was waiting for him, when Taggart returned to his office. Once 
they were alone, Taggart ' s manner changed. He leaned against the desk, 
sagging, his face loose and white. 

"Well?" he asked. 

Boyle spread his hands out helplessly. "I've checked, Jim," he said. 

"It's straight all right; d'Anconia's lost fifteen million dollars of his 
own money in those mines. No, there wasn't anything phony about that, he 
didn't pull any sort of trick, he put up his own cash and now he's lost it." 

"Well, what's he going to do about it?" 

"That- I don't know. Nobody does." 

"He's not going to let himself be robbed, is he? He's too smart for that. 
He must have something up his sleeve." 



"I sure hope so." 

"He's outwitted some of the slickest combinations of money-grubbers on 
earth. Is he going to be taken by a bunch of Greaser politicians with a 
decree? He must have something on them, and he'll get the last word, and we 
must be sure to be in on it, too!" 

"That's up to you, Jim. You're his friend." 

"Friend be damned! I hate his guts." 

He pressed a button for his secretary. The secretary entered uncertainly, 
looking unhappy; he was a young man, no longer too young, with a bloodless 
face and the well-bred manner of genteel poverty. 

"Did you get me an appointment with Francisco d'Anconia?" snapped Taggart. 

"No, sir." 

"But, God damn it, I told you to call the—" 
"I wasn't able to, sir. I have tried." 
"Well, try again." 

"I mean I wasn't able to obtain the appointment, Mr. Taggart." 

"Why not?" 

"He declined it." 

"You mean he refused to see me?" 

"Yes, sir, that is what I mean." 

"He wouldn't see me?" 

"No, sir, he wouldn't." 

"Did you speak to him in person?" 

"No, sir, I spoke to his secretary." 

"What did he tell you? Just what did he say?" The young man hesitated and 
looked more unhappy. "What did he say?" 

"He said that Senior d'Anconia said that you bore him, Mr. Taggart." 

The proposal which they passed was known as the "Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule." 
When they voted for it, the members of the National Alliance of Railroads sat 
in a large hall in the deepening twilight of a late autumn evening and did 
not look at one another. 

The National Alliance of Railroads was an organization formed, it was 
claimed, to protect the welfare of the railroad industry. This was to be 
achieved by developing methods of co-operation for a common purpose; this was 
to be achieved by the pledge of every member to subordinate his own interests 
to those of the industry as a whole; the interests of the industry as a whole 
were to be determined by a majority vote, and every member was committed to 
abide by any decision the majority chose to make. 

"Members of the same profession or of the same industry should stick 
together," the organizers of the Alliance had said. "We all have the same 
problems, the same interests, the same enemies. We waste our energy fighting 
one another, instead of presenting a common front to the world. 

We can all grow and prosper together, if we pool our efforts." "Against 
whom is this Alliance being organized?" a skeptic had asked. The answer had 
been: "Why, it's not 'against' anybody. But if you want to put it that way, 
why, it's against shippers or supply manufacturers or anyone who might try to 
take advantage of us. Against whom is any union organized?" "That's what I 
wonder about," the skeptic had said. 

When the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule was offered to the vote of the full 
membership of the National Alliance of Railroads at its annual meeting, it 
was the first mention of this Rule in public. But all the members had heard 
of it; it had been discussed privately for a long tune, and more insistently 
in the last few months. The men who sat in the large hall of the meeting were 
the presidents of the railroads. They did not like the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule; 
they had hoped it would never be brought up. 

But when it was brought up, they voted for it. 



No railroad was mentioned by name in the speeches that preceded the 
voting. The speeches dealt only with the public welfare. It was said that 
while the public welfare was threatened by shortages of transportation, 
railroads were destroying one another through vicious competition, on "the 
brutal policy of dog-eat-dog . " While there existed blighted areas where rail 
service had been discontinued, there existed at the same time large regions 
where two or more railroads were competing for a traffic barely sufficient 
for one. It was said that there were great opportunities for younger 
railroads in the blighted areas. While it was true that such areas offered 
little economic incentive at present, a public-spirited railroad, it was 
said, would undertake to provide transportation for the struggling 
inhabitants, since the prime purpose of a railroad was public service, not 
profit . 

Then it was said that large, established railroad systems were essential 
to the public welfare; and that the collapse of one of them would be a 
national catastrophe; and that if one such system had happened to sustain a 
crushing loss in a public-spirited attempt to contribute to international 
good will, it was entitled to public support to help it survive the blow. 

No railroad was mentioned by name. But when the chairman of the meeting 
raised his hand, as a solemn signal that they were about to vote, everybody 
looked at Dan Conway, president of the Phoenix-Durango . 

There were only five dissenters who voted against it. Yet when the 
chairman announced that the measure had passed, there was no cheering, no 
sounds of approval, no movement, nothing but a heavy silence. 

To the last minute, every one of them had hoped that someone would save 
them from it. 

The Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule was described as a measure of "voluntary self- 
regulation" intended "the better to enforce" the laws long since passed by 
the country's Legislature. The Rule provided that the members of the National 
Alliance of Railroads were forbidden to engage in practices defined as 
"destructive competition"; that in regions declared to be restricted, no more 
than one railroad would be permitted to operate; that in such regions, 
seniority belonged to the oldest railroad now operating there, and that the 
newcomers, who had encroached unfairly upon its territory, would suspend 
operations within nine months after being so ordered; that the Executive 
Board of the National Alliance of Railroads was empowered to decide, at its 
sole discretion, which regions were to be restricted. 

When the meeting adjourned, the men hastened to leave. There were no 
private discussions, no friendly loitering. The great hall became deserted in 
an unusually short time. Nobody spoke to or looked at Dan Conway. 

In the lobby of the building, James Taggart met Orren Boyle. They had made 
no appointment to meet, but Taggart saw a bulky figure outlined against a 
marble wall and knew who it was before he saw the face. They approached each 
other, and Boyle said, his smile less soothing than usual, "I've delivered. 
Your turn now, Jimmie." "You didn't have to come here. Why did you?" said 
Taggart sullenly. "Oh, just for the fun of it," said Boyle. 

Dan Conway sat alone among rows of empty seats. He was still! 

there when the charwoman came to clean the hall. When she hailed him, he 
rose obediently and shuffled to the door. Passing her in the aisle, he 
fumbled in his pocket and handed her a five dollar bill, silently, meekly, 
not looking at her face. He did not seem to know what he was doing; he acted 
as if he thought that he was in some place where generosity demanded that he 
give a tip before leaving. 

Dagny was still at her desk when the door of her office flew open and 
James Taggart rushed in. It was the first time he had ever entered in such 
manner. His face looked feverish. 



She had not seen him since the nationalization of the San Sebastian Line. 
He had not sought to discuss it with her, and she had said nothing about it. 
She had been proved right so eloquently, she had thought, that comments were 
unnecessary. A feeling which was part courtesy, part mercy had stopped her 
from stating to him the conclusion to be drawn from the events. In all reason 
and justice, there was but one conclusion he could draw. She had heard about 
his speech to the Board of Directors. She had shrugged, contemptuously 
amused; if it served his purpose, whatever that was, to appropriate her 
achievements, then, for his own advantage, if for no other reason, he would 
leave her free to achieve, from now on. 

"So you think you're the only one who's doing anything for this railroad?" 

She looked at Mm, bewildered. His voice was shrill; he stood in front of 
her desk, tense with excitement. 

"So you think that I've ruined the company, don't you?" he yelled. 

"And now you're the only one who can save us? Think I have no way to make 
up for the Mexican loss?" 

She asked slowly, "What do you want?" 

"I want to tell you some news. Do you remember the Anti-dog-eat dog 
proposal of the Railroad Alliance that I told you about months ago? 
You didn't like the idea. You didn't like it at all." 
"I remember. What about it?" 
"It has been passed." 
"What has been passed?" 

"The Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule. Just a few minutes ago. At the meeting. 
Nine months from now, there's not going to be any Phoenix-Durango Railroad 
in Colorado ! " 

A glass ashtray crashed to the floor off the desk, as she leaped to her 
feet . 

"You rotten bastards ! " 

He stood motionless. He was smiling. 

She knew that she was shaking, open to him, without defense, and that this 
was the sight he enjoyed, but it did not matter to her. Then she saw his 
smile— and suddenly the blinding anger vanished. She felt nothing. She studied 
that smile with a cold, impersonal curiosity. 

They stood facing each other. He looked as if, for the first time, he was 
not afraid of her. He was gloating. The event meant something to him much 
beyond the destruction of a competitor. It was not a victory over Dan Conway, 
but over her. She did not know why or in what manner, but she felt certain 
that he knew. 

For the flash of one instant, she thought that here, before her, in James 
Taggart and in that which made him smile, was a secret she had never 
suspected, and it was crucially important that she learn to understand it. 
But the thought flashed and vanished. 

She whirled to the door of a closet and seized her coat. 

"Where are you going?" Taggart ' s voice had dropped; it sounded 
disappointed and faintly worried. 

She did not answer. She rushed out of the office. 

"Dan, you have to fight them. I'll help you. I'll fight for you with 
everything I've got." 

Dan Conway shook his head. 

He sat at his desk, the empty expanse of a faded blotter before him, one 
feeble lamp lighted in a corner of the room. Dagny had rushed straight to the 
city office of the Phoenix-Durango. Conway was there, and he still sat as she 
had found him. He had smiled at her entrance and said, "Funny, I thought you 
would come," his voice gentle, lifeless. 

They did not know each other well, but they had met a few times in 
Colorado . 



"No," he said, "it's no use." 

"Do you mean because of that Alliance agreement that you signed? 

It won't hold. This is plain expropriation. No court will uphold it. And 
if Jim tries to hide behind the usual looters' slogan of 'public welfare, ' 

I'll go on the stand and swear that Taggart Transcontinental can't handle 
the whole traffic of Colorado, And if any court rules against you, you can 
appeal and keep on appealing for the next ten years." 

"Yes," he said, "I could . . .I'm not sure I'd win, but I could try and I 
could hang onto the railroad for a few years longer, but . . . No, it's not 
the legal points that I'm thinking about, one way or the other. It's not 
that. " 

"What, then?" 

"I don't want to fight it, Dagny." 

She looked at him incredulously. It was the one sentence which, she felt 
sure, he had never uttered before; a man could not reverse himself so late in 
life. 

Dan Conway was approaching fifty. He had the square, stolid, stubborn face 
of a tough freight engineer, rather than a company president; the face of a 
fighter, with a young, tanned skin and graying hair. He had taken over a 
shaky little railroad in Arizona, a road whose net revenue was "less than 
that of a successful grocery store, and he had built it into the best 
railroad of the Southwest. He spoke little, seldom read books, had never gone 
to college. The whole sphere of human endeavors, with one exception, left him 
blankly indifferent; he had no touch of that which people called culture. But 
he knew railroads. 

"Why don't you want to fight?" 

"Because they had the right to do it." 

"Dan," she asked, "have you lost your mind?" 

"I've never gone back on my word in my life," he said tonelessly. "I don't 
care what the courts decide. I promised to obey the majority. I have to 
obey. " 

"Did you expect the majority to do this to you?" 

"No." There was a kind of faint convulsion in the stolid face. He spoke 
softly, not looking at her, the helpless astonishment still raw within him. 
"No, I didn't expect it. I heard them talking about it for over a year, but I 
didn't believe it. Even when they were voting, I didn't believe it." 

"What did you expect?" 

"I thought . . . They said all of us were to stand for the common good. I 
thought what I had done down there in Colorado was good. 
Good for everybody." 

"Oh, you damn fool! Don't you see that that's what you're being punished 
for— because it was good?" 

He shook his head. "I don't understand it," he said. "But I see no way 
out . " 

"Did you promise them to agree to destroy yourself?" 
"There doesn't seem to be any choice for any of us." 
"What do you mean?" 

"Dagny, the whole world's in a terrible state right now. I don't know 
what's wrong with it, but something's very wrong. Men have to get together 
and find a way out. But who's to decide which way to take, unless it's the 
majority? I guess that's the only fair method of deciding, I don't see any 
other. I suppose somebody's got to be sacrificed. If it turned out to be me, 
I have no right to complain. The right's on their side. Men have to get 
together . " 

She made an effort to speak calmly; she was trembling with anger. 



"If that's the price of getting together, then I'll be damned if I want to 
live on the same earth with any human beings! If the rest of them can survive 
only by destroying us, then why should we wish them to survive? 

Nothing can make self-immolation proper. Nothing can give them the right 
to turn men into sacrificial animals. Nothing can make it moral to destroy 
the best. One can't be punished for being good. One can't be penalized for 
ability. If that is right, then we'd better start slaughtering one another, 
because there isn't any right at all in the world!" 

He did not answer. He looked at her helplessly. 

"If it's that kind of world, how can we live in it?" she asked. 
"I don't know . . ."he whispered. 

"Dan, do you really think it's right? In all truth, deep down, do you 
think it's right?" 

He closed his eyes. "No," he said. Then he looked at her and she saw a 
look of torture for the first time. "That's what I've been sitting here 
trying to understand. I know that I ought to think it's right— but I can't. 
It's as if my tongue wouldn't turn to say it. I keep seeing every tie of the 
track down there, every signal light, every bridge, every night that I spent 
when . . ." His head dropped down on his arms. "Oh God, it's so damn unjust!" 

"Dan," she said through her teeth, "fight it." 

He raised his head. His eyes were empty. "No," he said. "It would be 
wrong- I'm just selfish." 

"Oh, damn that rotten tripe! You know better than that!" 

"I don't know . . ." His voice was very tired. "I've been sitting here, 
trying to think about it ... I don't know what is right any more. . . ." 

He added, "I don't think I care." 

She knew suddenly that all further words were useless and that Dan Conway 
would never be a man of action again. She did not know what made her certain 
of it. She said, wondering, "You've never given up in the face of a battle 
before . " 

"No, I guess I haven't. . . ."He spoke with a quiet, indifferent 
astonishment. "I've fought storms and floods and rock slides and rail 
fissure. ... I knew how to do it, and I liked doing it. . . . But this kind 
of battle— it's one I can't fight." 

"Why?" 

"I don't know. Who knows why the world is what it if-? Oh, who is John 
Gait?" 

She winced. "Then what are you going to do?" 
"I don't know . . . 
"I mean—" She stopped. 

He knew what she meant. "Oh, there's always something to do. . . ." 

He spoke without conviction. "I guess it's only Colorado and New Mexico 
that they're going to declare restricted. I'll still have the line in Arizona 
to run." He added, "As it was twenty years ago . . . 

Well, it will keep me busy. I'm getting tired, Dagny. I didn't take time 
to notice it, but I guess I am." 

She could say nothing. 

"I'm not going to build a line through one of their blighted areas," 

he said in the same indifferent voice. "That's what they tried to hand me 
for a consolation prize, but I think it's just talk. You can't build a 
railroad where there's nothing for hundreds of miles but a couple of farmers 
who ' re not growing enough to feed themselves. You can't build a road and make 
it pay. If you don't make it pay, who's going to? It doesn't make sense to 
me. They just didn't know what they were saying." 

"Oh, to hell with their blighted areas! It's you I'm thinking about." 

She had to name it. "What will you do with yourself?" 



"I don't know . . . Well, there's a lot of things I haven't had time to 
do. Fishing, for instance. I've always liked fishing. Maybe I'll start 
reading books, always meant to. Guess I'll take it easy now. Guess I'll go 
fishing. There's some nice places down in Arizona, where it's peaceful and 
quiet and you don't have to see a human being for miles. . . ." 

He glanced up at her and added, "Forget it. Why should you worry about 
me?" 

"It's not about you, it's . . . Dan," she said suddenly, "I hope you know 
it's not for your sake that I wanted to help you fight." 

He smiled; it was a faint, friendly smile. "I know," he said. 

"It's not out of pity or charity or any ugly reason like that. Look, I 
intended to give you the battle of your life, down there in Colorado. 

I intended to cut into your business and squeeze you to the wall and drive 
you out, if necessary, " 

He chuckled faintly; it was appreciation. "You would have made a pretty 
good try at it, too," he said. 

"Only I didn't think it would be necessary. I thought there was enough 
room there for both of us." 

"Yes," he said. "There was." 

"Still, if I found that there wasn't, I would have fought you, and if I 
could make my road better than yours, I'd have broken you and not given a 
damn about what happened to you. But this . . . Dan, I don't think I want to 
look at our Rio Norte Line now. I ... Oh God, Dan, I don't want to be a 
looter ! " 

He looked at her silently for a moment. It was an odd look, as if from a 
great distance. He said softly, "You should have been born about a hundred 
years earlier, kid. Then you would have had a chance." 

"To hell with that. I intend to make my own chance." 

"That's what I intended at your age." 

"You succeeded." 

"Have I?" 

She sat still, suddenly unable to move. 

He sat up straight and said sharply, almost as if he were issuing orders, 
"You'd better look at that Rio Norte Line of yours, and you'd better do it 
fast. Get it ready before I move out, because if you don't, that will be the 
end of Ellis Wyatt and all the rest of them down there, and they're the best 
people left in the country. You can't let that happen. It's all on your 
shoulders now. It would be no use trying to explain to your brother that it's 
going to be much tougher for you down there without me to compete with. But 
you and I know it. So go to it. Whatever you do, you won't be a looter. No 
looter could run a railroad in that part of the country and last at it. 
Whatever you make down there, you will have earned it. Lice like your brother 
don't count, anyway. It's up to you now." 

She sat looking at him, wondering what it was that had defeated a man of 
this kind; she knew that it was not James Taggart. 

She saw him looking at her, as if he were struggling with a question mark 
of his own. Then he smiled, and she saw, incredulously, that the smile held 
sadness and pity. 

"You'd better not feel sorry for me," he said. "I think, of the two of us, 
it's you who have the harder time ahead. And I think you're going to get it 
worse than I did." 

She had telephoned the mills and made an appointment to see Hank Rearden 
that afternoon. She had just hung up the receiver and was bending over the 
maps of the Rio Norte Line spread on her desk, when the door opened. Dagny 
looked up, startled; she did not expect the door of her office to open 
without announcement. 



The man who entered was a stranger. He was young, tall, and something 
about him suggested violence, though she could not say what it was, because 
the first trait one grasped about him was a quality of self-control that 
seemed almost arrogant. He had dark eyes, disheveled hair, and his clothes 
were expensive, but worn as if he did not care or notice what he wore. 

"Ellis Wyatt, " he said in self -introduction . 

She leaped to her feet, involuntarily. She understood why nobody had or 
could have stopped him in the outer office. 
"Sit down, Mr. Wyatt," she said, smiling. 

"It won't be necessary." He did not smile. "I don't hold long 
conferences . " 

Slowly, taking her time by conscious intention, she sat down and leaned 
back, looking at him. 
"Well?" she asked. 

"I came to see you because I understand you're the only one who's got any 
brains in this rotten outfit." 
"What can I do for you?" 

"You can listen to an ultimatum." He spoke distinctly, giving an unusual 
clarity to every syllable. "I expect Taggart Transcontinental, nine months 
from now, to run trains in Colorado as my business requires them to be run. 
If the snide stunt you people perpetrated on the Phoenix-Durango was done for 
the purpose of saving yourself from the necessity of effort, this is to give 
you notice that you will not get away with it. I made no demands on you when 
you could not give me the kind of service I needed. I found someone who 
could. Now you wish to force me to deal with you. You expect to dictate terms 
by leaving me no choice. You expect me to hold my business down to the level 
of your incompetence. This is to tell you that you have miscalculated." 

She said slowly, with effort, "Shall I tell you what I intend to do about 
our service in Colorado?" 

"No. I have no interest in discussions and intentions. I expect 
transportation. What you do to furnish it and how you do it, is your problem, 
not mine. I am merely giving you a warning. Those who wish to deal with me, 
must do so on my terms or not at all. I do not make terms with incompetence. 
If you expect to earn money by carrying the oil I produce, you must be as 
good at your business as I am at mine. I wish this to be understood." 

She said quietly, "I understand." 

"I shan't waste time proving to you why you'd better take my ultimatum 
seriously. If you have the intelligence to keep this corrupt organization 
functioning at all, you have the intelligence to judge this for yourself. We 
both know that if Taggart Transcontinental runs trains in Colorado the way it 
did five years ago, it will ruin me. I know that that is what you people 
intend to do. You expect to feed off me while you can and to find another 
carcass to pick dry after you have finished mine. That is the policy of most 
of mankind today. So here is my ultimatum: it is now in your power to destroy 
me; I may have to go; but if I go, I'll make sure that I take all the rest of 
you along with me." 

Somewhere within her, under the numbness that held her still to receive 
the lashing, she felt a small point of pain, hot like the pain of scalding. 
She wanted to tell him of the years she had spent looking for men such as he 
to work with; she wanted to tell him that his enemies were hers, that she was 
fighting the same battle; she wanted to cry to him: I'm not one of them! But 
she knew that she could not do it. She bore the responsibility for Taggart 
Transcontinental and for everything done in its name; she had no right to 
justify herself now. 

Sitting straight, her glance as steady and open as his, she answered 
evenly, "You will get the transportation you need, Mr. Wyatt." 



She saw a faint hint of astonishment in his face; this was not the manner 
or the answer he had expected; perhaps it was what she had not said that 
astonished him most: that she offered no defense, no excuses. He took a 
moment to study her silently. Then he said, his voice less sharp: "All right. 
Thank you. Good day." 

She inclined her head. He bowed and left the office. 

"That's the story, Hank. I had worked out an almost impossible schedule to 
complete the Rio Norte Line in twelve months. Now I'll have to do it in nine. 
You were to give us the rail over a period of one year. Can you give it to us 
within nine months? If there's any human way to do it, do it. If not, I'll 
have to find some other means to finish it." 

Rearden sat behind his desk. His cold, blue eyes made two horizontal cuts 
across the gaunt planes of his face; they remained horizontal, impassively 
half-closed; he said evenly, without emphasis: 'I'll do it." 

Dagny leaned back in her chair. The short sentence was a shock. It was not 
merely relief: it was the sudden realization that nothing else was necessary 
to guarantee that it would be done; she needed no proofs, no questions, no 
explanations; a complex problem could rest safely on three syllables 
pronounced by a man who knew what he was saying. 

"Don't show that you're relieved." His voice was mocking. "Not too 
obviously." His narrowed eyes were watching her with an unrevealing smile. "I 
might think that I hold Taggart Transcontinental in my power, " 

"You know that, anyway." 

"I do. And I intend to make you pay for it." 
"I expect to. How much?" 

"Twenty dollars extra per ton on the balance of the order delivered after 
today. " 

"Pretty steep, Hank. Is that the best price you can give me?" 
"No. But that's the one I'm going to get. I could ask twice that and you'd 
pay it." 

"Yes., I would. And you could. But you won't." 
"Why won't I?" 

"Because you need to have the Rio Norte Line built. It's your first 
showcase for Rearden Metal." 

He chuckled. "That's right. I like to deal with somebody who has no 
illusions about getting favors." 

"Do you know what made me feel relieved, when you decided to take 
advantage of it?" 

"What?" 

"That I was dealing, for once, with somebody who doesn't pretend to give 
favors . " 

His smile had a discernible quality now: it was enjoyment. "You always 
play it open, don't you?" he asked. 

"I've never noticed you doing otherwise." 

"I thought I was the only one who could afford to." 

"I'm not broke, in that sense, Hank." 

"I think I'm going to break you some day— in that sense." 
"Why?" 

"I've always wanted to." 

"Don't you have enough cowards around you?" 

"That's why I'd enjoy trying it— because you're the only exception. 

So you think it's right that I should squeeze every penny of profit I can, 
out of your emergency?" 

"Certainly. I'm not a fool. I don't think you're in business for my 
convenience . " 

"Don't you wish I were?" 

"I'm not a moocher, Hank." 



"Aren't you going to find it hard to pay?" 
"That's my problem, not yours. I want that rail." 
"At twenty dollars extra per ton?" 
"Okay, Hank." 

"Fine. You'll get the rail. I may get my exorbitant profit— or Taggart 
Transcontinental may crash before I collect it." 

She said, without smiling, "If I don't get that line built in nine months 
Taggart Transcontinental will crash." 

"It won't, so long as you run it," 

When he did not smile, his face looked inanimate, only his eyes remained 
alive, active with a cold, brilliant clarity of perception. But what he was 
made to feel by the things he perceived, no one would be permitted to know, 
she thought, perhaps not even himself. 

"They've done their best to make it harder for you, haven't they?" he 
said. 

"Yes. I was counting on Colorado to save the Taggart system. Now it's up 
to me to save Colorado. Nine months from now, Dan Conway will close his road 
If mine isn't ready, it won't be any use finishing it. 

You can't leave those men without transportation for a single day, let 
alone a week or a month. At the rate they've been growing, you can't stop 
them dead and then expect them to continue. It's like slamming brakes on an 
engine going two hundred miles an hour." 

"I know." 

"I can run a good railroad. I can't run it across a continent of 
sharecroppers who ' re not good enough to grow turnips successfully. I've got 
to have men like Ellis Wyatt to produce something to fill the trains I run. 
So I've got to give him a train and a track nine months from now, if I have 
to blast all the rest of us into hell to do it!" 

He smiled, amused. "You feel very strongly about it, don't you?" 

"Don't you?" 

He would not answer, but merely held the smile. 

"Aren't you concerned about it?" she asked, almost angrily. 

"No . " 

"Then you don't realize what it means?" 

"I realize that I'm going to get the rail rolled and you're going to get 
the track laid in nine months." 

She smiled, relaxing, wearily and a little guiltily. "Yes. I know we will 
I know it's useless— getting angry at people like Jim and his friends. We 
haven't any time for it. First, I have to undo what they've done. Then 
afterwards"— she stopped, wondering, shook her head and shrugged— "afterwards , 
they won't matter." 

"That's right. They won't. When I heard about that Anti-dog-eat-dog 
business, it made me sick. But don't worry about the goddamn bastards." 

The two words sounded shockingly violent, because his face and voice 
remained calm. "You and I will always be there to save the country from the 
consequences of their actions." He got up; he said, pacing the office, 
"Colorado isn't going to be stopped. You'll pull it through. Then Dan Conway 
will be back, and others. All that lunacy is temporary. ]t can't last. It's 
demented, so it has to defeat itself. You and I will just have to work a 
little harder for a while, that's all." 

She watched his tall figure moving across the office. The office suited 
him; it contained nothing but the few pieces of furniture he needed, all of 
them harshly simplified down to their essential purpose, all of them 
exorbitantly expensive in the quality of materials and the skill of design. 

The room looked like a motor— a motor held within the glass case of broad 
windows. But she noticed one astonishing detail: a vase of jade that stood o 
top of a filing cabinet. The vase was a solid, dark green stone carved into 



plain surfaces; the texture of its smooth curves provoked an irresistible 
desire to touch it. It seemed startling in that office, incongruous with the 
sternness of the rest: it was a touch of sensuality. 

"Colorado is a great place," he said. "It's going to be the greatest in 
the country. You're not sure that I'm concerned about it? That state's 
becoming one of my best customers, as you ought to know if you take time to 
read the reports on your freight traffic." 

"I know. I read them." 

"I've been thinking of building a plant there in a few years. To save them 
your transportation charges." He glanced at her. "You'll lose an awful lot of 
steel freight, if I do." 

"Go ahead. I'll be satisfied with carrying your supplies, and the 
groceries for your workers, and the freight of the factories that will follow 
you there— and perhaps I won't have time to notice that I've lost your steel. 
. . . What are you laughing at?" 

"It's wonderful." 

"What?" 

"The way you don't react as everybody else does nowadays." 
"Still, I must admit that for the time being you're the most important 
single shipper of Taggart Transcontinental." 
"Don't you suppose I know it?" 

"So I can't understand why Jim—" She stopped. 

"—tries his best to harm my business? Because your brother Jim is a fool." 
"He is. But it's more than that. There's something worse than stupidity 
about it." 

"Don't waste time trying to figure him out. Let him spit. He's no danger 
to anyone. People like Jim Taggart just clutter up the world." 
"I suppose so." 

"Incidentally, what would you have done if I'd said I couldn't deliver 
your rails sooner?" 

"I would have torn up sidings or closed some branch line, any branch line, 
and I would have used the rail to finish the Rio Norte track on time." 

He chuckled. "That's why I'm not worried about Taggart Transcontinental. 
But you won't have to start getting rail out of old sidings. Not so long as 
I'm in business." 

She thought suddenly that she was wrong about his lack of emotion: the 
hidden undertone of his manner was enjoyment. She realized that she had 
always felt a sense of light-hearted relaxation in his presence and known 
that he shared it. He was the only man she knew to whom she could speak 
without strain or effort. This, she thought, was a mind she respected, an 
adversary worth matching. Yet there had always been an odd sense of distance 
between them, the sense of a closed door; there was an impersonal quality in 
his manner, something within him that could not be reached. 

He had stopped at the window. He stood for a moment, looking out. "Do you 
know that the first load of rail is being delivered to you today?" he asked, 
"Of course I know it." 

"Come here." 

She approached him. He pointed silently. Far in the distance, beyond the 
mill structures, she saw a string of gondolas waiting on a siding. 

The bridge of an overhead crane cut the sky above them. The crane was 
moving. Its huge magnet held a load of rails glued to a disk by the sole 
power of contact. There was no trace of sun in the gray spread of clouds, yet 
the rails glistened, as if the metal caught light out of space. The metal was 
a greenish-blue. The great chain stopped over a car, descended, jerked in a 
brief spasm and left the rails in the car. The crane moved back in majestic 
indifference; it looked like the giant drawing of a geometrical theorem 
moving above the men and the earth. 



They stood at the window, watching silently, intently. She did not speak, 
until another load of green-blue metal came moving across the sky. Then the 
first words she said were not about rail, track or an order completed on 
time. She said, as if greeting a new phenomenon of nature: "Rearden Metal . . 

He noticed that, but said nothing. He glanced at her, then turned back to 
the window. 

"Hank, this is great." 
"Yes . " 

He said it simply, openly. There was no flattered pleasure in his voice, 
and no modesty. This, she knew, was a tribute to her, the rarest one person 
could pay another: the tribute of feeling free to acknowledge one's own 
greatness, knowing that it is understood. 

She said, "When I think of what that metal can do, what it will make 
possible . . . Hank, this is the most important thing happening in the world 
today, and none of them know it." 

"We know it." 

They did not look at each other. They stood watching the crane. On the 
front of the locomotive in the distance, she could distinguish the letters 
TT . She could distinguish the rails of the busiest industrial siding of the 
Taggart system. 

"As soon as I can find a plant able to do it," she said, "I'm going to 
order Diesels made of Rearden Metal." 

"You'll need them. How fast do you run your trains on the Rio Norte 
track?" 

"Now? We're lucky if we manage to make twenty miles an hour." 

He pointed at the cars. "When that rail is laid, you'll be able to run 
trains at two hundred and fifty, if you wish." 

"I will, in a few years, when we'll have cars of Rearden Metal, which will 
be half the weight of steel and twice as safe." 

"You'll have to look out for the air lines. We're working on a plane of 
Rearden Metal. It will weigh practically nothing and lift anything. 

You'll see the day of long-haul, heavy-freight air traffic." 

"I've been thinking of what that metal will do for motors, any motors, and 
what sort of thing one can design now." 

"Have you thought of what it will do for chicken wire? Just plain chicken- 
wire fences, made of Rearden Metal, that will cost a few pennies a mile and 
last two hundred years. And kitchenware that will be bought at the dime store 
and passed on from generation to generation. And ocean liners that one won't 
be able to dent with a torpedo." 

"Did I tell you that I'm having tests made of communications wire of 
Rearden Metal?" 

"I'm making so many tests that I'll never get through showing people what 
can be done with it and how to do it." 

They spoke of the metal and of the possibilities which they could not 
exhaust. It was as if they were standing on a mountain top, seeing a 
limitless plain below and roads open in all directions. But they merely spoke 
of mathematical figures, of weights, pressures, resistances, costs. 

She had forgotten her brother and his National Alliance. She had forgotten 
every problem, person and event behind her; they had always been clouded in 
her sight, to be hurried past, to be brushed aside, never final, never quite 
real. This was reality, she thought, this sense of clear outlines, of 
purpose, of lightness, of hope. This was the way she had expected to live— she 
had wanted to spend no hour and take no action that would mean less than 
this . 

She looked at him in the exact moment when he turned to look at her. They 
stood very close to each other. She saw, in his eyes, that he felt as she 



did. If joy is the aim and the core of existence, she thought, and if that 
which has the power to give one joy is always guarded as one's deepest 
secret, then they had seen each other naked in that moment. 

He made a step back and said in a strange tone of dispassionate wonder, 
"We're a couple of blackguards, aren't we?" 

"Why?" 

"We haven't any spiritual goals or qualities. All we're after is material 
things. That's all we care for," 

She looked at him, unable to understand. But he was looking past her, 
straight ahead, at the crane in the distance. She wished he had not said it. 
The accusation did not trouble her, she never thought of herself in such 
terms and she was completely incapable of experiencing a feeling of 
fundamental guilt. But she felt a vague apprehension which she could not 
define, the suggestion that there was something of grave consequence in 
whatever had made him say it, something dangerous to him. He had not said it 
casually. But there had been no feeling in his voice, neither plea nor shame. 
He had said it indifferently, as a statement of fact. 

Then, as she watched him, the apprehension vanished. He was looking at his 
mills beyond the window; there was no guilt in his face, no doubt, nothing 
but the calm of an inviolate self-confidence. 

"Dagny" he said, "whatever we are, it's we who move the world and it's we 
who'll pull it through." 



CHAPTER V 
THE CLIMAX OF THE D'ANCONIAS 

The newspaper was the first thing she noticed. It was clutched tightly in 
Eddie's hand, as he entered her office. She glanced up at his face: it was 
tense and bewildered. 

"Dagny, are you very busy?" 

"Why?" 

"I know that you don't like to talk about him. But there's something here 
I think you ought to see." 

She extended her hand silently for the newspaper. 

The story on the front page announced that upon taking over the San 
Sebastian Mines, the government of the People's State of Mexico had 
discovered that they were worthless— blatantly, totally, hopelessly worthless. 
There was nothing to justify the five years of work and the millions spent; 
nothing but empty excavations, laboriously cut. The few traces of copper were 
not worth the effort of extracting them. No great deposits of metal existed 
or could be expected to exist there, and there were no indications that could 
have permitted anyone to be deluded. The government of the People's State of 
Mexico was holding emergency sessions about their discovery, in an uproar of 
indignation; they felt that they had been cheated. 

Watching her, Eddie knew that Dagny sat looking at the newspaper long 
after she had finished reading. He knew that he had been right to feel a hint 
of fear, even though he could not tell what frightened him about that story. 

He waited. She raised her head. She did not look at him. Her eyes were 
fixed, intent in concentration, as if trying to discern something at a great 
distance . 

He said, his voice low, "Francisco is not a fool. Whatever else he may be, 
no matter what depravity he's sunk to— and I've given up trying to figure out 
why— he is not a fool. He couldn't have made a mistake of this kind. It is not 
possible. I don't understand it." 

"I'm beginning to." 

She sat up, jolted upright by a sudden movement that ran through her body 
like a shudder. She said: "Phone him at the Wayne-Falkland and tell the 
bastard that I want to see him." 

"Dagny," he said sadly, reproachfully, "it's Frisco d'Anconia." 

"It was." 

She walked through the early twilight of the city streets to the Wayne- 
Falkland Hotel. "He says, any time you wish," Eddie had told her. The first 
lights appeared in a few windows high under the clouds. 

The skyscrapers looked like abandoned lighthouses sending feeble, dying 
signals out into an empty sea where no ships moved any longer. 

A few snowflakes came down, past the dark windows of empty stores, to melt 
in the mud of the sidewalks. A string of red lanterns cut the street, going 
off into the murky distance. 

She wondered why she felt that she wanted to run, that she should be 
running; no, not down this street; down a green hillside in the blazing sun 
to the road on the edge of the Hudson, at the foot of the Taggart estate. 
That was the way she always ran when Eddie yelled, "It's Frisco d'Anconia!" 
and they both flew down the hill to the car approaching on the road below. 

He was the only guest whose arrival was an event in their childhood, their 
biggest event. The running to meet him had become part of a contest among the 
three of them. There was a birch tree on the hillside, halfway between the 
road and the house; Dagny and Eddie tried to get past the tree, before 
Francisco could race up the hill to meet them. On all the many days of his 
arrivals, in all the many summers, they never reached the birch tree; 



Francisco reached it first and stopped them when he was way past it. 
Francisco always won, as he always won everything. 

His parents were old friends of the Taggart family. He was an only son and 
he was being brought up all over the world; his father, it was said, wanted' 
him to consider the world as his future domain. 

Dagny and Eddie could never be certain of where he would spend his winter; 
but once a year, every summer, a stern South American tutor brought him for a 
month to the Taggart estate. 

Francisco found it natural that the Taggart children should be chosen as 
his companions: they were the crown heirs of Taggart Transcontinental, as he 
was of d'Anconia Copper. "We are the only aristocracy left in the world— the 
aristocracy of money," he said to Dagny once, when he was fourteen. "It's the 
only real aristocracy, if people understood what it means, which they don't." 

He had a caste system of his own: to him, the Taggart children were not 
Jim and Dagny, but Dagny and Eddie. He seldom volunteered to notice Jim's 
existence. Eddie asked him once, "Francisco, you're some kind of very high 
nobility, aren't you?" He answered, "Not yet. 

The reason my family has lasted for such a long lime is that none of us 
has ever been permitted to think he is born a d'Anconia. We are expected to 
become one." He pronounced his name as if he wished his listeners to be 
struck in the face and knighted by the sound of it. 

Sebastian d'Anconia, his ancestor, had left Spain many centuries ago, at a 
time when Spain was the most powerful country on earth and his was one of 
Spain's proudest figures. He left, because the lord of the Inquisition did 
not approve of his manner of thinking and suggested, at a court banquet, that 
he change it. Sebastian d'Anconia threw the contents of his wine glass at the 
face of the lord of the Inquisition, and escaped before he could be seized. 
He left behind him his fortune, his estate, his marble palace and the girl he 
loved— and he sailed to a new world. 

His first estate in Argentina was a wooden shack in the foothills of the 
Andes. The sun blazed like a beacon on the silver coat-of-arms of the 
d'Anconias, nailed over the door of the shack, while Sebastian d'Anconia dug 
for the copper of his first mine. He spent years, pickax in hand, breaking 
rock from sunrise till darkness, with the help of a few stray derelicts: 
deserters from the armies of his countrymen, escaped convicts, starving 
Indians . 

Fifteen years after he left Spain, Sebastian d'Anconia sent for the girl 
he loved; she had waited for him. When she arrived, she found the silver 
coat-of-arms above the entrance of a marble palace, the gardens of a great 
estate, and mountains slashed by pits of red ore in the distance. He carried 
her in his arms across the threshold of his home. He looked younger than when 
she had seen him last. 

"My ancestor and yours," Francisco told Dagny, "would have liked each 
other . " 

Through the years of her childhood, Dagny lived in the future— in the world 
she expected to find, where she would not have to feel contempt or boredom. 
But for one month each year, she was free. For one month, she could live in 
the present. When she raced down the hill to meet Francisco d'Anconia, it was 
a release from prison. 

"Hi, Slug!" 

"Hi, Frisco!" 

They had both resented the nicknames, at first. She had asked him angrily, 
"What do you think you mean?" He had answered, "In case you don't know it, 
'Slug' means a great fire in a locomotive firebox." 

"Where did you pick that up?" "From the gentlemen along the Taggart iron." 
He spoke five languages, and he spoke English without a trace of accent, a 
precise, cultured English deliberately mixed with slang. She had retaliated 



by calling him Frisco. He had laughed, amused and annoyed. "If you barbarians 
had to degrade the name of a great city of yours, you could at least refrain 
from doing it to me." But they had grown to like the nicknames. 

It had started in the days of their second summer together, when he was 
twelve years old and she was ten. That summer, Francisco began vanishing 
every morning for some purpose nobody could discover. He went off on his 
bicycle before dawn, and returned in time to appear at the white and crystal 
table set for lunch on the terrace, his manner courteously punctual and a 
little too innocent. He laughed, refusing to answer, when Dagny and Eddie 
questioned him. They tried to follow him once, through the cold, pre-morning 
darkness, but they gave it up; no one could track him when he did not want to 
be tracked. 

After a while, Mrs. Taggart began, to worry and decided to investigate. 
She never learned how he had managed to by-pass all the child-labor laws, but 
she found Francisco working— by an unofficial deal with the dispatcher— as a 
call boy for Taggart Transcontinental, at a division point ten miles away. 
The dispatcher was stupefied by her personal visit; he had no idea that his 
call boy was a house guest of the Taggarts. The boy was known to the local 
railroad crews as Frankie, and Mrs. Taggart preferred not to enlighten them 
about his full name. 

She merely explained that he was working without his parents' permission 
and had to quit at once. The dispatcher was sorry to lose him; Frankie, he 
said, was the best call boy they had ever had. "I'd sure like to keep him on. 
Maybe we could make a deal with his parents?" he suggested. "I'm afraid not." 
said Mrs. Taggart faintly. 

"Francisco, " she asked, when she brought him home, "what would your father 
say about this, if he knew?" 

"My father would ask whether I was good at the job or not. 

That's all he'd want to know." 

"Come now, I'm serious." 

Francisco was looking at her politely, his courteous manner suggesting 
centuries of breeding and drawing rooms; but something in his eyes made her 
feel uncertain about the politeness. "Last winter," he answered, "I shipped 
out as cabin boy on a cargo steamer that carried d'Anconia copper. My father 
looked for me for three months, but that's all he asked me when I came back." 

"So that's how you spend your winters?" said Jim Taggart. Jim's smile had 
a touch of triumph, the triumph of finding cause to feel contempt. 

"That was last winter, " Francisco answered pleasantly, with no change in 
the innocent, casual tone of his voice. "The winter before last I spent in 
Madrid, at the home of the Duke of Alba." 

"Why did you want to work on a railroad?" asked Dagny. 

They stood looking at each other: hers was a glance of admiration, his of 
mockery; but it was not the mockery of malice— it was the laughter of a 
salute . 

"To learn what it's like, Slug," he answered, "and to tell you that I've 
had a job with Taggart Transcontinental before you did." 

Dagny and Eddie spent their winters trying to master some new skill, in 
order to astonish Francisco and beat him, for once. They never succeeded. 
When they showed him how to hit a ball with a bat, a game he had never played 
before, he watched them for a few minutes, then said, "I think I get the 
idea. Let me try." He took the bat and sent the ball flying over a line of 
oak trees far at the end of the field. 

When Jim was given a motorboat for his birthday, they all stood on the 
river landing, watching the lesson, while an instructor showed Jim how to run 
it. None of them had ever driven a motorboat before. The sparkling white 
craft, shaped like a bullet, kept staggering clumsily across the water, its 
wake a long record of shivering, its motor choking with hiccoughs, while the 



instructor, seated beside him, kept seizing the wheel out of Jim's hands. For 
no apparent reason, Jim raised his head suddenly and yelled at Francisco, "Do 
you think you can do it any better?" "I can do it." "Try it!" 

When the boat came back and its two occupants stepped out, Francisco 
slipped behind the wheel. "Wait a moment," he said to the instructor, who 
remained on the landing. "Let me take a look at this." 

Then, before the instructor had time to move, the boat shot out to the 
middle of the river, as if fired from a gun. It was streaking away before 
they grasped what they were seeing. As it went shrinking into the distance 
and sunlight, Dagny's picture of it was three straight lines: its wake, the 
long shriek of its motor, and the aim of the driver at its wheel. 

She noticed the strange expression of her father's face as he looked at 
the vanishing speedboat. He said nothing; he just stood looking. She 
remembered that she had seen him look that way once before. It was when he 
inspected a complex system of pulleys which Francisco, aged twelve, had 
erected to make an elevator to the top of a rock; he was teaching Dagny and 
Eddie to dive from the rock into the Hudson. Francisco's notes of calculation 
were still scattered about on the ground; her father picked them up, looked 
at them, then asked, "Francisco, how many years of algebra have you had?" 
"Two years." "Who taught you to do this?" "Oh, that's just something I 
figured out." She did not know that what her father held on the crumpled 
sheets of paper was the crude version of a differential equation. 

The heirs of Sebastian d'Anconia had been an unbroken line of first sons, 
who knew how to bear his name. It was a tradition of the family that the man 
to disgrace them would be the heir who died, leaving the d'Anconia fortune no 
greater than he had received it. Throughout the generations, that disgrace 
had not come. An Argentinian legend said that the hand of a d'Anconia had the 
miraculous power of the saints- 
only it was not the power to heal, but the power to produce. 

The d'Anconia heirs had been men of unusual ability, but none of them 
could match what Francisco d'Anconia promised to become. It was as if the 
centuries had sifted the family's qualities through a fine mesh, had 
discarded the irrelevant, the inconsequential, the weak, and had let nothing 
through except pure talent; as if chance, for once, had achieved an entity 
devoid of the accidental. 

Francisco could do anything he undertook, he could do it better than 
anyone else, and he did it without effort. There was no boasting in his 
manner and consciousness, no thought of comparison. His attitude was not: "I 
can do it better than you," but simply: "I can do it." What he meant by doing 
was doing superlatively. 

No matter what discipline was required of him by his father's exacting 
plan for his education, no matter what subject he was ordered to study, 
Francisco mastered it with effortless amusement. His father adored him, but 
concealed it carefully, as he concealed the pride of knowing that he was 
bringing up the most brilliant phenomenon of a brilliant family line. 

Francisco, it was said, was to be the climax of the d'Anconias. 

"I don't know what sort of motto the d'Anconias have on their family 
crest," Mrs. Taggart said once, "but I'm sure that Francisco will change it 
to 'What for?' " It was the first question he asked about any activity 
proposed to him— and nothing would make him act, if he found no valid answer. 
He flew through the days of his summer month like a rocket, but if one 
stopped him in mid-flight, he could always name the purpose of his every 
random moment. Two things were impossible to him: to stand still or to move 
aimlessly . 

"Let's find out" was the motive he gave to Dagny and Eddie for anything he 
undertook, or "Let's make it." These were his only forms of enjoyment. 



"I can do it, " he said, when he was building his elevator, clinging to the 
side of a cliff, driving metal wedges into rock, his arms moving with an 
expert's rhythm, drops of blood slipping, unnoticed, from under a bandage on 
his wrist. "No, we can't take turns, Eddie, you're not big enough yet to 
handle a hammer. Just cart the weeds off and keep the way clear for me, I'll 
do the rest. . . . What blood? Oh, that's nothing, just a cut I got 
yesterday. Dagny, run to the house and bring me a clean bandage." 

Jim watched them. They left him alone, but they often saw him standing in 
the distance, watching Francisco with a peculiar kind of intensity. 

He seldom spoke in Francisco's presence. But he would corner Dagny and he 
would smile derisively, saying, "AH those airs you put on, pretending that 
you're an iron woman with a mind of her own! You're a spineless dishrag, 
that's all you are. It's disgusting, the way you let that conceited punk 
order you about. He can twist you around his little finger. You haven't any 
pride at all. The way you run when he whistles and wait on him! Why don't you 
shine his shoes?" "Because he hasn't told me to," she answered. 

Francisco could win any game in any local contest. He never entered 
contests. He could have ruled the junior country club. He never came within 
sight of their clubhouse, ignoring their eager attempts to enroll the most 
famous heir in the world. Dagny and Eddie were his only friends. They could 
not tell whether they owned him or were owned by him completely; it made no 
difference: either concept made them happy. 

The three of them set out every morning on adventures of their own kind. 
Once, an elderly professor of literature, Mrs. Taggart's friend, saw them on 
top of a pile in a junk yard, dismantling the carcass of an automobile. He 
stopped, shook his head and said to Francisco, "A young man of your position 
ought to spend his time in libraries, absorbing the culture of the world." 
"What do you think I'm doing?" asked Francisco. 

There were no factories in the neighborhood, but Francisco taught Dagny 
and Eddie to steal rides on Taggart trains to distant towns, where they 
climbed fences into mill yards or hung on window sills, watching machinery as 
other children watched movies. "When I run Taggart Transcontinental . . ." 
Dagny would say at times. "When I run d'Anconia Copper . . ." said Francisco. 
They never had to explain the rest to each other; they knew each other's goal 
and motive. 

Railroad conductors caught them, once in a while. Then a stationmaster a 
hundred miles away would telephone Mrs. Taggart: "We've got three young 
tramps here who say that they are—" "Yes," Mrs. Taggart would sigh, "they 
are. Please send them back." 

"Francisco, " Eddie asked him once, as they stood by the tracks of the 
Taggart station, "you've been just about everywhere in the world. 

What's the most important thing on earth?" "This," answered Francisco, 
pointing to the emblem TT on the front of an engine. He added, "I wish I 
could have met Nat Taggart." 

He noticed Dagny' s glance at him. He said nothing else. But minutes later, 
when they went on through the woods, down a narrow path of damp earth, ferns 
and sunlight, he said, "Dagny, I'll always bow to a coat-of -arms . I'll always 
worship the symbols of nobility. Am I not supposed to be an aristocrat? Only 
I don't give a damn for moth-eaten turrets and tenth-hand unicorns. The 
coats-of -arms of our day are to be found on billboards and in the ads of 
popular magazines." "What do you mean?" asked Eddie. "Industrial trademarks, 
Eddie," he answered. 

Francisco was fifteen years old, that summer. 

"When I run d'Anconia Copper . . ." "I'm studying mining and mineralogy, 
because I must be ready for the time when I run d'Anconia Copper. . . ." "I'm 
studying electrical engineering, because power companies are the best 



customers of d'Anconia Copper. . . . " "I'm going to study philosophy, because 
I'll need it to protect d'Anconia Copper. . . ." 

"Don't you ever think of anything but d'Anconia Copper?" Jim asked him 
once . 

"No . " 

"It seems to me that there are other things in the world." 
"Let others think about them." 
"Isn't that a very selfish attitude?" 
"It is." 

"What are you after?" 
"Money. " 

"Don't you have enough?" 

"In his lifetime, every one of my ancestors raised the production of 
d'Anconia Copper by about ten per cent. I intend to raise it by one hundred." 
"What for?" Jim asked, in sarcastic imitation of Francisco's voice. 
"When I die, I hope to go to heaven— whatever the hell that is— 
and I want to be able to afford the price of admission." 
"Virtue is the price of admission," Jim said haughtily. 

"That's what I mean, James. So I want to be prepared to claim the greatest 
virtue of all— that I was a man who made money." 
"Any grafter can make money." 

"James, you ought to discover some day that words have an exact meaning." 

Francisco smiled; it was a smile of radiant mockery. Watching them, Dagny 
thought suddenly of the difference between Francisco and her brother Jim. 
Both of them smiled derisively. But Francisco seemed to laugh at things 
because he saw something much greater. Jim laughed as if he wanted to let 
nothing remain great. 

She noticed the particular quality of Francisco's smile again, one night, 
when she sat with him and Eddie at a bonfire they had built in the woods. The 
glow of the fire enclosed them within a fence of broken, moving strips that 
held pieces of tree trunks, branches and distant stars. 

She felt as if there were nothing beyond that fence, nothing but black 
emptiness, with the hint of some breath-stopping, frightening promise . . . 
like the future. But the future, she thought, would be like Francisco's 
smile, there was the key to it, the advance warning of its nature —in his 
face in the firelight under the pine branches— and suddenly she felt an 
unbearable happiness, unbearable because it was too full and she had no way 
to express it. She glanced at Eddie. He was looking at Francisco. In some 
quiet way of his own, Eddie felt as she did. 

"Why do you like Francisco?" she asked him weeks later, when Francisco was 
gone . 

Eddie looked astonished; it had never occurred to him that the feeling 
could be questioned. He said, "He makes me feel safe." 
She said, "He makes me expect excitement and danger." 

Francisco was sixteen, next summer, the day when she stood alone with him 
on the summit of a cliff by the river, their shorts and shirts torn in their 
climb to the top. They stood looking down the Hudson; they had heard that on 
clear days one could see New York in the distance. But they saw only a haze 
made of three different kinds of light merging together: the river, the sky 
and the sun. 

She knelt on a rock, leaning forward, trying to catch some hint of the 
city, the wind blowing her hair across her eyes. She glanced back over her 
shoulder— and saw that Francisco was not looking at the distance: he stood 
looking at her. It was an odd glance, intent and unsmiling. She remained 
still for a moment, her hands spread flat on the rock, her arms tensed to 
support the weight of her body; inexplicably, his glance made her aware of 
her pose, of her shoulder showing through the torn shirt, of her long, 



scratched, sunburned legs slanting from the rock to the ground. She stood up 
angrily and backed away from him. And while throwing her head up, resentment 
in her eyes to meet the sternness in his, while feeling certain that his was 
a glance of condemnation and hostility, she heard herself asking him, a tone 
of smiling defiance in her voice: "What do you like about me?" 

He laughed; she wondered, aghast, what had made her say it. He answered, 
"There's what I like about you," pointing to the glittering rails of the 
Taggart station in the distance. 

"It's not mine," she said, disappointed. 

"What I like is that it's going to be." 

She smiled, conceding his victory by being openly delighted. She did not 
know why he had looked at her so strangely; but she felt that he had seen 
some connection, which she could not grasp, between her body and something 
within her that would give her the strength to rule those rails some day. 

He said brusquely, "Let's see if we can see New York," and jerked her by 
the arm to the edge of the cliff. She thought that he did not notice that he 
twisted her arm in a peculiar way, holding it down along the length of his 
side; it made her stand pressed against him, and she felt the warmth of the 
sun in the skin of his legs against hers. They looked far out into the 
distance, but they saw nothing ahead except a haze of light. 

When Francisco left, that summer, she thought that his departure was; like 
the crossing of a frontier which ended his childhood: he was to start 
college, that fall. Her turn would come next. She felt an eager impatience 
touched by the excitement of fear, as if he had leaped into an unknown 
danger. It was like the moment, years ago, when she had seen him dive first 
from a rock into the Hudson, had seen him vanish under the black water and 
had stood, knowing that he would reappear in an instant and that it would 
then be her turn to follow. 

She dismissed the fear; dangers, to Francisco, were merely opportunities 
for another brilliant performance; there were no battles he could lose, no 
enemies to beat him. And then she thought of a remark she had heard a few 
years earlier. It was a strange remark— and it was strange that the words had 
remained in her mind, even though she had thought them senseless at the time. 
The man who said it was an old professor of mathematics, a friend of her 
father, who came to their country house for just that one visit. She liked 
his face, and she could still see the peculiar sadness in his eyes when he 
said to her father one evening, sitting on the terrace in the fading light, 
pointing to Francisco's figure in the garden, "That boy is vulnerable. He has 
too great a capacity for joy. 

What will he do with it in a world where there's so little occasion for 
it?" 

Francisco went to a great American school, which his father had chosen for 
him long ago. It was the most distinguished institution of learning left in 
the world, the Patrick Henry University of Cleveland. 

He did not come to visit her in New York, that winter, even though he was 
only a night's journey away. They did not write to each other, they had never 
done it. But she knew that he would come back to the country for one summer 
month . 

There were a few times, that winter, when she felt an undefined 
apprehension: the professor's words kept returning to her mind, as a warning 
which she could not explain. She dismissed them. When she thought of 
Francisco, she felt the steadying assurance that she would have another month 
as an advance against the future, as a proof that the world she saw ahead was 
real, even though it was not the world of those around her. 

"Hi, Slug!" 

"Hi, Frisco!" 



Standing on the hillside, in the first moment of seeing him again, she 
grasped suddenly the nature of that world which they, together, held against 
all others. It was only an instant's pause, she felt her cotton skirt beating 
in the wind against her knees, felt the sun on her eyelids, and the upward 
thrust of such an immense relief that she ground her feet into the grass 
under her sandals, because she thought she would rise, weightless, through 
the wind. 

It was a sudden sense of freedom and safety— because she realized that she 
knew nothing about the events of his life, had never known and would never 
need to know. The world of chance— of families, meals, schools, people, of 
aimless people dragging the load of some unknown guilt— was not theirs, could 
not change him, could not matter. He and she had never spoken of the things 
that happened to them, but only of what they thought and of what they would 
do. . . . She looked at him silently, as if a voice within her were saying: 
Not the things that are, but the things we'll make ... We are not to be 
stopped, you and I . . . 

Forgive me the fear, if I thought I could lose you to them— forgive me the 
doubt, they'll never reach you— I'll never be afraid for you again. . . . 

He, too, stood looking at her for a moment— and it seemed to her that it 
was not a look of greeting after an absence, but the look of someone who had 
thought of her every day of that year. She could not be certain, it was only 
an instant, so brief that just as she caught it, he was turning to point at 
the birch tree behind him and saying in the tone of their childhood game: "I 
wish you'd learn to run faster. I'll always have to wait for you." 

"Will you wait for me?" she asked gaily. 

He answered, without smiling, "Always." 

As they went up the hill to the house, he spoke to Eddie, while she walked 
silently by his side. She felt that there was a new reticence between them 
which, strangely, was a new kind of intimacy. 

She did not question him about the university. Days later, she asked him 
only whether he liked it. 

"They're teaching a lot of drivel nowadays," he answered, "but there are a 
few courses I like." 

"Have you made any friends there?" 

"Two. " 

He told her nothing else. 

Jim was approaching his senior year in a college in New York. His studies 
had given him a manner of odd, quavering belligerence, as if he had found a 
new weapon. He addressed Francisco once, without provocation, stopping him in 
the middle of the lawn to say in a tone of aggressive self-righteousness: "I 
think that now that you've reached college age, you ought to learn something 
about ideals. It's time to forget your selfish greed and give some thought to 
your social responsibilities, because I think that all those millions you're 
going to inherit are not for your personal pleasure, they are a trust for the 
benefit of the underprivileged and the poor, because I think that the person 
who doesn't realize this is the most depraved type of human being." 

Francisco answered courteously, "It is not advisable, lames, to venture 
unsolicited opinions. You should spare yourself the embarrassing discovery of 
their exact value to your listener." 

Dagny asked him, as they walked away, "Are there many men like Jim in the 
world?" 

Francisco laughed. "A great many." 
"Don't you mind it?" 

"No. I don't have to deal with them. Why do you ask that?" 

"Because I think they're dangerous in some way ... I don't know how . . 

"Good God, Dagny! Do you expect me to be afraid of an object like James?" 



It was days later, when they were alone, walking through the woods on the 
shore of the river, that she asked: "Francisco, what's the most depraved type 
of human being?" 

"The man without a purpose." 

She was looking at the straight shafts of the trees that stood against the 
great, sudden, shining spread of space beyond. The forest was dim and cool, 
but the outer branches caught the hot, silver sunrays from the water. She 
wondered why she enjoyed the sight, when she had never taken any notice of 
the country around her, why she was so aware of her enjoyment, of her 
movements, of her body in the process of walking. 

She did not want to look at Francisco. She felt that his presence seemed 
more intensely real when she kept her eyes away from him, almost as if the 
stressed awareness of herself came from him, like the sunlight from the 
water . 

"You think you're good, don't you?" he asked. 

"I always did," she answered defiantly, without turning. 

"Well, let me sec you prove it. Let me see how far you'll rise with 
Taggart Transcontinental. No matter how good you are, I'll expect you to 
wring everything you've got, trying to be still better. And when you've worn 
yourself out to reach a goal, I'll expect you to start for another." 

"Why do you think that I care to prove anything to you?" she asked. 

"Want me to answer?" 

"No, " she whispered, her eyes fixed upon the other shore of the river in 
the distance. 

She heard him chuckling, and after a while he said, "Dagny, there's 
nothing of any importance in life— except how well you do your work. 

Nothing. Only that. Whatever else you are, will come from that. It's the 
only measure of human value. All the codes of ethics they'll try to ram down 
your throat are just so much paper money put out by swindlers to fleece 
people of their virtues. The code of competence is the only system of 
morality that's on a gold standard. When you grow up, you'll know what I 
mean . " 

"I know it now. But . . . Francisco, why are you and I the only ones who 
seem to know it?" 

"Why should you care about the others?" 

"Because I like to understand things, and there's something about people 
that I can't understand." 
"What?" 

"Well, I've always been unpopular in school and it didn't bother me, but 
now I've discovered the reason. It's an impossible kind of reason. 

They dislike me, not because I do things badly, but because I do them 
well. They dislike me because I've always had the best grades in the class. I 
don't even have to study. I always get A's. Do you suppose I should try to 
get D's for a change and become the most popular girl in school?" 

Francisco stopped, looked at her and slapped her face. 

What she felt was contained in a single instant, while the ground rocked 
under her feet, in a single blast of emotion within her. She knew that she 
would have killed any other person who struck her; she felt the violent fury 
which would have given her the strength for it— and as violent a pleasure that 
Francisco had done it. She felt pleasure from the dull, hot pain in her cheek 
and from the taste of blood in the corner of her mouth. She felt pleasure in 
what she suddenly grasped about him, about herself and about his motive. 

She braced her feet to stop the dizziness, she held her head straight and 
stood facing him in the consciousness of a new power, feeling herself his 
equal for the first time, looking at him with a mocking smile of triumph. 

"Did I hurt you as much as that?" she asked. 



He looked astonished; the question and the smile were not those of a 
child. He answered, "Yes— if it pleases you." 
"It does." 

"Don't ever do that again. Don't crack jokes of that kind." 
"Don't be a fool. Whatever made you think that I cared about being 
popular? " 

"When you grow up, you'll understand what sort of unspeakable thing you 
said. " 

"I understand it now." 

He turned abruptly, took out his handkerchief and dipped it in the water 
of the river. "Come here," he ordered. 

She laughed, stepping back, "Oh no. I want to keep it as it is. I hope it 
swells terribly. I like it." 

He looked at her for a long moment. He said slowly, very earnestly, 
"Dagny, you're wonderful." 

"I thought that you always thought so, " she answered, her voice insolently 
casual . 

When she came home, she told her mother that she had cut her lip by 
falling against a rock. It was the only lie she ever told. She did not do it 
to protect Francisco; she did it because she felt, for some reason which she 
could not define, that the incident was a secret too precious to share, Next 
summer, when Francisco came, she was sixteen. She started running down the 
hill to meet him, but stopped abruptly. He saw it, stopped, and they stood 
for a moment, looking at each other across the distance of a long, green 
slope. It was he who walked up toward her, walked very slowly, while she 
stood waiting. 

When he approached, she smiled innocently, as if unconscious of any 
contest intended or won. 

"You might like to know," she said, "that I have a job on the railroad. 
Night operator at Rockdale." 

He laughed. "All right, Taggart Transcontinental, now it's a race. 
Let's see who'll do greater honor, you— to Nat Taggart, or I— to Sebastian 
d ' Anconia . " 

That winter, she stripped her life down to the bright simplicity of a 
geometrical drawing: a few straight lines— to and from the engineering college 
in the city each day, to and from her job at Rockdale Station each night— and 
the closed circle of her room, a room littered with diagrams of motors, 
blueprints of steel structures, and railroad timetables. 

Mrs. Taggart watched her daughter in unhappy bewilderment. She could have 
forgiven all the omissions, but one: Dagny showed no sign of interest in men, 
no romantic inclination whatever. Mrs. Taggart did not approve of extremes; 
she had been prepared to contend with an extreme of the opposite kind, if 
necessary; she found herself thinking that this was worse. She felt 
embarrassed when she had to admit that her daughter, at seventeen, did not 
have a single admirer. 

"Dagny and Francisco d'Anconia?" she said, smiting ruefully, in answer to 
the curiosity of her friends. "Oh no, it's not a romance. It's an 
international industrial cartel of some kind. That's all they seem to care 
about . " 

Mrs. Taggart heard James say one evening, in the presence of guests, a 
peculiar tone of satisfaction in his voice, "Dagny, even though you were 
named after her, you really look more like Nat Taggart than like that first 
Dagny Taggart, the famous beauty who was his wife." Mrs. Taggart did not know 
which offended her most: that James said it or that Dagny accepted it happily 
as a compliment. 

She would never have a chance, thought Mrs. Taggart, to form some 
conception of her own daughter. Dagny was only a figure hurrying in and out 



of the apartment, a slim figure in a leather jacket, with a raised collar, a 
short skirt and long show-girl legs. She walked, cutting across a room, with 
a masculine, straight-line abruptness, but she had a peculiar grace of motion 
that was swift, tense and oddly, challengingly feminine. 

At times, catching a glimpse of Dagny's face, Mrs. Taggart caught an 
expression which she could not quite define: it was much more than gaiety, it 
was the look of such an untouched purity of enjoyment that she found it 
abnormal, too: no young girl could be so insensitive as to have discovered no 
sadness in life. Her daughter, she concluded, was incapable of emotion. 

"Dagny.," she asked once, "don't you ever want to have a good time?" Dagny 
looked at her incredulously and answered, "What do you think I'm having?" 

The decision to give her daughter a formal debut cost Mrs. Taggart a great 
deal of anxious thought. She did not know whether she was introducing to New 
York society Miss Dagny Taggart of the Social Register or the night operator 
of Rockdale Station; she was inclined to believe it was more truly this last; 
and she felt certain that Dagny would reject the idea of such an occasion. 
She was astonished when Dagny accepted it with inexplicable eagerness, for 
once like a child. 

She was astonished again, when she saw Dagny dressed for the party, It was 
the first feminine dress she had ever worn— a gown of white chiffon with a 
huge skirt that floated like a cloud. Mrs. Taggart had expected her to look 
like a preposterous contrast. Dagny looked like a beauty. She seemed both 
older and more radiantly innocent than usual; standing in front of a mirror, 
she held her head as Nat Taggart ' s wife would have held it. 

"Dagny," Mrs. Taggart said gently, reproachfully, "do you see how 
beautiful you can be when you want to?" 

"Yes," said Dagny, without any astonishment. 

The ballroom of the Wayne-Falkland Hotel had been decorated under Mrs. 
Taggart ' s direction; she had an artist's taste, and the setting of that 
evening was her masterpiece. "Dagny, there are things I would like you to 
learn to notice," she said, "lights, colors, flowers, music. 

They are not as negligible as you might think." "I've never thought 
they're negligible," Dagny answered happily. For once, Mrs. Taggart felt a 
bond between them; Dagny was looking at her with a child's grateful trust. 
"They're the things that make life beautiful," said Mrs. 

Taggart. "I want this evening to be very beautiful for you, Dagny. The 
first ball is the most romantic event of one's life." 

To Mrs. Taggart, the greatest surprise was the moment when she saw Dagny 
standing under the lights, looking at the ballroom. This was not a child, not 
a girl, but a woman of such confident, dangerous power that Mrs. Taggart 
stared at her with shocked admiration. In an age of casual, cynical, 
indifferent routine, among people who held themselves as if they were not 
flesh, but meat— Dagny's bearing seemed almost indecent, because this was the 
way a woman would have faced a ballroom centuries ago, when the act of 
displaying one's half-naked body for the admiration of men was an act of 
daring, when it had meaning, and but one meaning, acknowledged by all as a 
high adventure. And this— thought Mrs. Taggart, smiling— was the girl she had 
believed to be devoid of sexual capacity. She felt an immense relief, and a 
touch of amusement at the thought that a discovery of this kind should make 
her feel relieved. 

The relief lasted only for a few hours. At the end of the evening, she saw 
Dagny in a corner of the ballroom, sitting on a balustrade as if it were a 
fence rail, her legs dangling under the chiffon skirt as if she were dressed 
in slacks. She was talking to a couple of helpless young men, her face 
contemptuously empty. 

Neither Dagny nor Mrs. Taggart said a word when they rode home together. 
But hours later, on a sudden impulse, Mrs. Taggart went to her daughter's 



room. Dagny stood by the window, still wearing the white evening gown; it 
looked like a cloud supporting a body that now seemed too thin for it, a 
small body with sagging shoulders. Beyond the window, the clouds were gray in 
the first light of morning. 

When Dagny turned, Mrs. Taggart saw only puzzled helplessness in her face; 
the face was calm, but something about it made Mrs. Taggart wish she had not 
wished that her daughter should discover sadness. 

"Mother, do they think it's exactly in reverse?" she asked. 

"What?" asked Mrs. Taggart, bewildered. 

"The things you were talking about. The lights and the flowers. Do they 
expect those things to make them romantic, not the other way around?" 
"Darling, what do you mean?" 

"There wasn't a person there who enjoyed it," she said, her voice 
lifeless, "or who thought or felt anything at all. They moved about, and they 
said the same dull things they say anywhere. I suppose they thought the 
lights would make it brilliant." 

"Darling, you take everything too seriously. One is not supposed to be 
intellectual at a ball. One is simply supposed to be gay." 

"How? By being stupid?" 

"I mean, for instance, didn't you enjoy meeting the young men?" 

"What men? There wasn't a man there I couldn't squash ten of." 

Days later, sitting at her desk at Rockdale Station, feeling 
lightheartedly at home, Dagny thought of the party and shrugged in 
contemptuous reproach at her own disappointment. She looked up: it was spring 
and there were leaves on the tree branches in the darkness outside; the air 
was still and warm. She asked herself what she had expected from that party. 
She did not know. But she felt it again, here, now, as she sat slouched over 
a battered desk, looking out into the darkness: a sense of expectation 
without object, rising through her body, slowly, like a warm liquid. She 
slumped forward across the desk, lazily, feeling neither exhaustion nor 
desire to work. 

When Francisco came, that summer, she told him about the party and about 
her disappointment. He listened silently, looking at her for the first time 
with that glance of unmoving mockery which he reserved for others, a glance 
that seemed to see too much. She felt as if he heard, in her words, more than 
she knew she told him. 

She saw the same glance in his eyes on the evening when she left him too 
early. They were alone, sitting on the shore of the river. 

She had another hour before she was due at Rockdale. There were long, thin 
strips of fire in the sky, and red sparks floating lazily on the water. He 
had been silent for a long time, when she rose abruptly and told him that she 
had to go. He did not try to stop her; he leaned back, his elbows in the 
grass, and looked at her without moving; his glance seemed to say that he 
knew her motive. Hurrying angrily up the slope to the house, she wondered 
what had made her leave; she did not know; it had been a sudden restlessness 
that came from a feeling she did not identify till now: a feeling of 
expectation . 

Each night, she drove the five miles from the country house to Rockdale. 
She came back at dawn, slept a few hours and got up with the rest of the 
household. She felt no desire to sleep. Undressing for bed in the first rays 
of the sun, she felt a tense, joyous, causeless impatience to face the day 
that was starting. 

She saw Francisco's mocking glance again, across the net of a tennis 
court. She did not remember the beginning of that game; they had often played 
tennis together and he had always won. She did not know at what moment she 
decided that she would win, this time. 



When she became aware of it, it was no longer a decision or a wish, but a 
quiet fury rising within her. She did not know why she had to win; she did 
not know why it seemed so crucially, urgently necessary; she knew only that 
she had to and that she would. 

It seemed easy to play; it was as if her will had vanished and someone's 
power were playing for her. She watched Francisco's figure — a tall, swift 
figure, the suntan of his arms stressed by his short white shirt sleeves. She 
felt an arrogant pleasure in seeing the skill of his movements, because this 
was the thing which she would beat, so that his every expert gesture became 
her victory, and the brilliant competence of his body became the triumph of 
hers . 

She felt the rising pain of exhaustion— not knowing that it was pain, 
feeling it only in sudden stabs that made her aware of some part of her body 
for an instant, to be forgotten in the next: her arm socket— 

her shoulder blades— her hips, with the white shorts sticking to her skin — 
the muscles of her legs, when she leaped to meet the ball, but did not 
remember whether she came down to touch the ground again— her eyelids, when 
the sky went dark red and the ball came at her through the darkness like a 
whirling white flame— the thin, hot wire that shot from her ankle, up her 
back, and went on shooting straight across the air, driving the ball at 
Francisco's figure. . . . She felt an exultant pleasure— because every stab of 
pain begun in her body had to end in his, because he was being exhausted as 
she was— what she did to herself, she was doing it also to him— this was what 
he felt— this was what she drove him to— it was not her pain that she felt or 
her body, but his. 

In the moments when she saw his face, she saw that he was laughing. 

He was looking at her as if he understood. He was playing, not to win, but 
to make it harder for her— sending his shots wild to make her run —losing 
points to see her twist her body in an agonizing backhand- 
standing still, letting her think he would miss, only to let his arm shoot 
out casually at the last moment and send the ball back with such force that 
she knew she would miss it. She felt as if she could not move again, not 
ever— and it was strange to find herself landing suddenly at the other side of 
the court, smashing the ball in time, smashing it as if she wished it to 
burst to pieces, as if she wished it were Francisco's face. 

Just once more, she thought, even if the next one would crack the bones of 
her arm . . . Just once more, even if the air which she forced down in gasps 
past her tight, swollen throat, would be stopped altogether . . . Then she 
felt nothing, no pain, no muscles, only the thought that she had to beat him, 
to see him exhausted, to see him collapse, and then she would be free to die 
in the next moment . 

She won. Perhaps it was his laughing that made him lose, for once. 

He walked to the net, while she stood still, and threw his racket across, 
at her feet, as if knowing that this was what she wanted. He walked out of 
the court and fell down on the grass of the lawn, collapsing, his head on his 
arm. 

She approached him slowly. She stood over him, looking down at his body 
stretched at her feet, looking at his sweat-drenched shirt and the strands of 
his hair spilled across his arm. He raised his head. His glance moved slowly 
up the line of her legs, to her shorts, to her blouse, to her eyes. It was a 
mocking glance that seemed to see straight through her clothes and through 
her mind. And it seemed to say that he had won. 

She sat at her desk at Rockdale, that night, alone in the old station 
building, looking at the sky in the window. It was the hour she liked best, 
when the top panes of the window grew lighter, and the rails of the track 
outside became threads of blurred silver across the lower panes. She turned 
off her lamp and watched the vast, soundless motion of light over a 



motionless earth. Things stood still, not a leaf trembled on the branches, 
while the sky slowly lost its color and became an expanse that looked like a 
spread of glowing water. 

Her telephone was silent at this hour, almost as if movement had stopped 
everywhere along the system. She heard steps approaching outside, suddenly, 
close to the door. Francisco came in. He had never come here before, but she 
was not astonished to see him. 

"What are you doing up at this hour?" she asked. 

"I didn't feel like sleeping." 

"How did you get here? I didn't hear your car." 
"I walked." 

Moments passed before she realized that she had not asked him why he came 
and that she did not want to ask it. 

He wandered through the room, looking at the clusters of waybills that 
hung on the walls, at the calendar with a picture of the Taggart Comet caught 
in a proud surge of motion toward the onlooker. He seemed casually at home, 
as if he felt that the place belonged to them, as they always felt wherever 
they went together. But he did not seem to want to talk. He asked a few 
questions about her job, then kept silent. 

As the light grew outside, movement grew down on the line and the 
telephone started ringing in the silence. She turned to her work. He sat in a 
corner, one leg thrown over the arm of his chair, waiting. 

She worked swiftly, feeling inordinately clear-headed. She found pleasure 
in the rapid precision of her hands. She concentrated on the sharp, bright 
sound of the phone, on the figures of train numbers, car numbers, order 
numbers. She was conscious of nothing else. 

But when a thin sheet of paper fluttered down to the floor and she bent to 
pick it up, she was suddenly as intently conscious of that particular moment, 
of herself and her own movement. She noticed her gray linen skirt, the rolled 
sleeve of her gray blouse and her naked arm reaching down for the paper. She 
felt her heart stop causelessly in the kind of gasp one feels in moments of 
anticipation. She picked up the paper and turned back to her desk. 

It was almost full daylight. A train went past the station, without 
stopping. In the purity of the morning light, the long line of car roofs 
melted into a silver string, and the train seemed suspended above the ground, 
not quite touching it, going past through the air. The floor of the station 
trembled., and glass rattled in the windows. She watched the train's flight 
with a smile of excitement. She glanced at Francisco: he was looking at her, 
with the same smile. 

When the day operator arrived, she turned the station over to him, and 
they walked out into the morning air. The sun had not yet risen and the air 
seemed radiant in its stead. She felt no exhaustion. She felt as if she were 
just getting up. 

She started toward her car, but Francisco said, "Let's walk home. 
We'll come for the car later." 
"All right." 

She was not astonished and she did not mind the prospect of walking five 
miles. It seemed natural; natural to the moment's peculiar reality that was 
sharply clear, but cut off from everything, immediate, but disconnected, like 
a bright island in a wall of fog, the heightened, unquestioning reality one 
feels when one is drunk. 

The road led through the woods. They left the highway for an old trail 
that went twisting among the trees across miles of untouched country. There 
were no traces of human existence around them. Old ruts, overgrown with 
grass, made human presence seem more distant, adding the distance of years to 
the distance of miles. A haze of twilight remained over the ground, but in 
the breaks between the tree trunks there were leaves that hung in patches of 



shining green and seemed to light the forest. The leaves hung still. They 
walked, alone to move through a motionless world. She noticed suddenly that 
they had not said a word for a long time. 

They came to a clearing. It was a small hollow at the bottom of a shaft 
made of straight rock hillsides. A stream cut across the grass, and tree 
branches flowed low to the ground, like a curtain of green fluid. 

The sound of the water stressed the silence. The distant cut of open sky 
made the place seem more hidden. Far above, on the crest of a hill, one tree 
caught the first rays of sunlight. 

They stopped and looked at each other. She knew, only when he did it, that 
she had known he would. He seized her, she felt her lips in his mouth, felt 
her arms grasping him in violent answer, and knew for the first time how much 
she had wanted him to do it. 

She felt a moment's rebellion and a hint of fear. He held her, pressing 
the length of his body against hers with a tense, purposeful insistence, his 
hand moving over her breasts as if he were learning a proprietor's intimacy 
with her body, a shocking intimacy that needed no consent from her, no 
permission. She tried to pull herself away, but she only leaned back against 
his arms long enough to see his face and his smile, the smile that told her 
she had given him permission long ago. She thought that she must escape; 
instead, it was she who pulled his head down to find his mouth again. 

She knew that fear was useless, that he would do what he wished, that the 
decision was his, that he left nothing possible to her except the thing she 
wanted most— to submit. She had no conscious realization of his purpose, her 
vague knowledge of it was wiped out, she had no power to believe it clearly, 
in this moment, to believe it about herself, she knew only that she was 
afraid— yet what she felt was as if she were crying to him: Don't ask me for 
it— oh, don't ask me— do it! 

She braced her feet for an instant, to resist, but his mouth was pressed 
to hers and they went down to the ground together, never breaking their lips 
apart. She lay still— as the motionless, then the quivering object of an act 
which he did simply, unhesitatingly, as of right, the right of the 
unendurable pleasure it gave them. 

He named what it meant to both of them in the first words he spoke 
afterwards. He said, "We had to learn it from each other." She looked at his 
long figure stretched on the grass beside her, he wore black slacks and a 
black shirt, her eyes stopped on the belt pulled tight across his slender 
waistline, and she felt the stab of an emotion that was like a gasp of pride, 
pride in her ownership of his body. She lay on her back, looking up at the 
sky, feeling no desire to move or think or know that there was any time 
beyond this moment. 

When she came home, when she lay in bed, naked because her body had become 
an unfamiliar possession, too precious for the touch of a nightgown, because 
it gave her pleasure to feel naked and to feel as if the white sheets of her 
bed were touched by Francisco's body— when she thought that she would not 
sleep, because she did not want to rest and lose the most wonderful 
exhaustion she had ever known— her last thought was of the times when she had 
wanted to express, but found no way to do it, an instant's knowledge of a 
feeling greater than happiness, the feeling of one's blessing upon the whole 
of the earth, the feeling of being in love with the fact that one exists and 
in this kind of world; she thought that the act she had learned was the way 
one expressed it. If this was a thought of the gravest importance, she did 
not know it; nothing could be grave in a universe from which the concept of 
pain had been wiped out; she was not there to weigh her conclusion; she was 
asleep, a faint smile on her face, in a silent, luminous room filled with the 
light of morning. 



That summer, she met him in the woods, in hidden corners by the river, on 
the floor of an abandoned shack, in the cellar of the house. 

These were the only times when she learned to feel a sense of beauty— 
by looking up at old wooden rafters or at the steel plate of an air 
conditioning machine that whirred tensely, rhythmically above their heads. 
She wore slacks or cotton summer dresses, yet she was never so feminine as 
when she stood beside him, sagging in his arms, abandoning herself to 
anything he wished, in open acknowledgment of his power to reduce her to 
helplessness by the pleasure he had the power to give her. He taught her 
every manner of sensuality he could invent. "Isn't it wonderful that our 
bodies can give us so much pleasure?" he said to her once, quite simply. They 
were happy and radiantly innocent. They were both incapable of the conception 
that joy is sin. 

They kept their secret from the knowledge of others, not as a shameful 
guilt, but as a thing that was immaculately theirs, beyond anyone's right of 
debate or appraisal. She knew the general doctrine on sex, held by people in 
one form or another, the doctrine that sex was an ugly weakness of man's 
lower nature, to be condoned regretfully. She experienced an emotion of 
chastity that made her shrink, not from the desires of her body, but from any 
contact with the minds who held this doctrine. 

That winter, Francisco came to see her in New York, at unpredictable 
intervals. He would fly down from Cleveland, without warning, twice a week, 
or he would vanish for months. She would sit on the floor of her room, 
surrounded by charts and blueprints, she would hear a knock at her door and 
snap, "I'm busy!" then hear a mocking voice ask, "Are you?" and leap to her 
feet to throw the door open, to find him standing there. They would go to an 
apartment he had rented in the city, a small apartment in a quiet 
neighborhood. "Francisco," she asked him once, in sudden astonishment, "I'm 
your mistress, am I not?" He laughed. "That's what you are." She felt the 
pride a woman is supposed to experience at being granted the title of wife. 

In the many months of his absence, she never wondered whether he was true 
to her or not; she knew he was. She knew, even though she was too young to 
know the reason, that indiscriminate desire and unselective indulgence were 
possible only to those who regarded sex and themselves as evil. 

She knew little about Francisco's life. It was his last year in college; 
he seldom spoke of it, and she never questioned him. She suspected that he 
was working too hard, because she saw, at times, the unnaturally bright look 
of his face, the look of exhilaration that comes from driving one's energy 
beyond its limit. She laughed at him once, boasting that she was an old 
employee of Taggart Transcontinental, while he had not started to work for a 
living. He said, "My father refuses to let me work for d'Anconia Copper until 
I graduate." "When did you learn to be obedient?" "I must respect his wishes. 
He is the owner of d'Anconia Copper. . . . He is not, however, the owner of 
all the copper companies in the world." There was a hint of secret amusement 
in his smile. 

She did not learn the story until the next fall, when he had graduated and 
returned to New York after a visit to his father in Buenos Aires. 

Then he told her that he had taken two courses of education during the 
last four years: one at the Patrick Henry University, the other in a copper 
foundry on the outskirts of Cleveland. "I like to learn things for myself," 
he said. He had started working at the foundry as furnace boy, when he was 
sixteen— and now, at twenty, he owned it. He acquired his first title of 
property, with the aid of some inaccuracy about his age, on the day when he 
received his university diploma, and he sent them both to his father. 

He showed her a photograph of the foundry. It was a small, grimy place, 
disreputable with age, battered by years of a losing struggle; above its 



entrance gate, like a new flag on the mast of a derelict, hung the sign: 
d'Anconia Copper. 

The public relations man of his father's office in New York had moaned, 
outraged, "But, Don Francisco, you can't do that! What will the public think? 
That name on a dump of this kind?" "It's my name," 

Francisco had answered. 

When he entered his father's office in Buenos Aires, a large room, severe 
and modern as a laboratory, with photographs of the properties of d'Anconia 
Copper as sole ornament on its walls— photographs of the greatest mines, ore 
docks and foundries in the world— he saw, in the place of honor, facing his 
father's desk, a photograph of the Cleveland foundry with the new sign above 
its gate. 

His father's eyes moved from the photograph to Francisco's face as he 
stood in front of the desk. 

"Isn't it a little too soon?" his father asked. 

"I couldn't have stood four years of nothing but lectures." 

"Where did you get the money for your first payment on that property?" 

"By playing the New York stock market, " 

"What? Who taught you to do that?" 

"It is not difficult to judge which industrial ventures will succeed and 
which won ' t . " 

"Where did you get the money to play with?" 

"From the allowance you sent me, sir, and from my wages." 

"When did you have time to watch the stock market?" 

"While I was writing a thesis on the influence— upon subsequent 
metaphysical systems— of Aristotle's theory of the Immovable Mover." 

Francisco's stay in New York was brief, that fall. His father was sending 
him to Montana as assistant superintendent of a d'Anconia mine. "Oh well," he 
said to Dagny, smiling, "my father does not think it advisable to let me rise 
too fast. I would not ask him to take me on faith. If he wants a factual 
demonstration, I shall comply." In the spring, Francisco came back— as head of 
the New York office of d'Anconia Copper. 

She did not see him often in the next two years. She never knew where he 
was, in what city or on what continent, the day after she had seen him. He 
always came to her unexpectedly— and she liked it, because it made him a 
continuous presence in her life, like the ray of a hidden light that could 
hit her at any moment. 

Whenever she saw him in his office, she thought of his hands as she had 
seen them on the wheel of a motorboat: he drove his business HI with the same 
smooth, dangerous, confidently mastered speed. But one small incident 
remained in her mind as a shock: it did not fit him. 

She saw him standing at the window of his office, one evening, looking at 
the brown winter twilight of the city. He did not move for a long time. His 
face was hard and tight; it had the look of an emotion she had never believed 
possible to him: of bitter, helpless anger. He said, "There's something wrong 
in the world. There's always been. Something no one has ever named or 
explained." He would not tell her what it was. 

When she saw him again, no trace of that incident remained in his manner. 
It was spring and they stood together on the roof terrace of a restaurant, 
the light silk of her evening gown blowing in the wind against his tall 
figure in formal black clothes. They looked at the city. 

In the dining room behind them, the sounds of the music were a concert 
etude by Richard Halley; Halley's name was not known to many, but they had 
discovered it and they loved his music. Francisco said, "We don't have to 
look for skyscrapers in the distance, do we? 



We've reached them." She smiled and said, "I think we're going past them. 
. . . I'm almost afraid . . . we're on a speeding elevator of some kind." 
"Sure. Afraid of what? Let it speed. Why should there be a limit?" 

He was twenty-three when his father died and he went to Buenos Aires to 
take over the d'Anconia estate, now his. She did not see him for three years. 

He wrote to her, at first, at random intervals. He wrote about d'Anconia 
Copper, about the world market, about issues affecting the interests of 
Taggart Transcontinental. His letters were brief, written by hand, usually at 
night . 

She was not unhappy in his absence. She, too, was making her first steps 
toward the control of a future kingdom. Among the leaders of industry, her 
father's friends, she heard it said that one had better watch the young 
d'Anconia heir; if that copper company had been great before, it would sweep 
the world now, under what his management promised to become. She smiled, 
without astonishment. There were moments when she felt a sudden, violent 
longing for him, but it was only impatience, not pain. She dismissed it, in 
the confident knowledge that they were both working toward a future that 
would bring them everything they wanted, including each other. Then his 
letters stopped. 

She was twenty-four on that day of spring when the telephone rang on her 
desk, in an office of the Taggart Building. "Dagny, " said a voice she 
recognized at once, "I'm at the Wayne-Falkland. Come to have dinner with me 
tonight. At seven." He said it without greeting, as if they had parted the 
day before. Because it took her a moment to regain the art of breathing, she 
realized for the first time how much that voice meant to her. "All right . . 
. Francisco," she answered. They needed to say nothing else. She thought, 
replacing the receiver, that his return was natural and as she had always 
expected it to happen, except that she had not expected her sudden need to 
pronounce his name or the stab of happiness she felt while pronouncing it. 

When she entered his hotel room, that evening, she stopped short. 

He stood in the middle of the room, looking at her— and she saw a smile 
that came slowly, involuntarily, as if he had lost the ability to smile and 
were astonished that he should regain it. He looked at her incredulously, not 
quite believing what she was or what he felt. His glance was like a plea, 
like the cry for help of a man who could never cry. At her entrance, he had 
started their old salute, he had started to say, "Hi—" but he did not finish 
it. Instead, after a moment, he said, "You're beautiful, Dagny." He said it 
as if it hurt him. 

"Francisco, I—" 

He shook his head, not to let her pronounce the words they had never said 
to each other— even though they knew that both had said and heard them in that 
moment . 

He approached, he took her in his arms, he kissed her mouth and held her 
for a long time. When she looked up at his face, he was smiling down at her 
confidently, derisively. It was a smile that told her he was in control of 
himself, of her, of everything, and ordered her to forget what she had seen 
in that first moment. "Hi, Slug," he said. 

Feeling certain of nothing except that she must not ask questions, she 
smiled and said, "Hi, Frisco." 

She could have understood any change, but not the things she saw. 

There was no sparkle of life in his face, no hint of amusement; the face 
had become implacable. The plea of his first smile had not been a plea of 
weakness; he had acquired an air of determination that seemed merciless. He 
acted like a man who stood straight, under the weight of an unendurable 
burden. She saw what she could not have believed possible: that there were 
lines of bitterness in his face and that he looked tortured. 



"Dagny, don't be astonished by anything I do," he said, "or by anything I 
may ever do in the future." 

That was the only explanation he granted her, then proceeded to act as if 
there were nothing to explain. 

She could feel no more than a faint anxiety; it was impossible to fee! 

fear for his fate or in his presence. When he laughed, she thought they 
were back in the woods by the Hudson: he had not changed and never would. 

The dinner was served in his room. She found it amusing to face him across 
a table laid out with the icy formality pertaining to excessive cost, in a 
hotel room designed as a European palace. 

The Wayne-Falkland was the most distinguished hotel left on any continent. 
Its style of indolent luxury, of velvet drapes, sculptured panels and 
candlelight, seemed a deliberate contrast to its function: no one could 
afford its hospitality except men who came to New York on business, to settle 
transactions involving the world. She noticed that the manner of the waiters 
who served their dinner suggested a special deference to this particular 
guest of the hotel, and that Francisco did not notice it. He was 
indifferently at home. He had long since become accustomed to the fact that 
he was Senor d'Anconia of d'Anconia Copper. 

But she thought it strange that he did not speak about his work. She had 
expected it to be his only interest, the first thing he would share with her. 
He did not mention it. He led her to talk, instead, about her job, her 
progress, and what she felt for Taggart Transcontinental. She spoke of it as 
she had always spoken to him, in the knowledge that he was the only one who 
could understand her passionate devotion. He made no comment, but he listened 
intently . 

A waiter had turned on the radio for dinner music; they had paid no 
attention to it. But suddenly, a crash of sound jarred the room, almost as if 
a subterranean blast had struck the walls and made them tremble. The shock 
came, not from the loudness, but from the quality of the sounds. It was 
Halley's new Concerto, recently written, the Fourth. 

They sat in silence, listening to the statement of rebellion— the anthem of 
the triumph of the great victims who would refuse to accept pain. Francisco 
listened, looking out at the city. 

Without transition or warning, he asked, his voice oddly unstressed, 
"Dagny, what would you say if I asked you to leave Taggart Transcontinental 
and let it go to hell, as it will when your brother takes over?" 

"What would I say if you asked me to consider the idea of committing 
suicide?" she answered angrily. 

He remained silent. 

"Why did you say that?" she snapped. "I didn't think you'd joke about it. 
It's not like you." 

There was no touch of humor in his face. He answered quietly, gravely, 
"No. Of course. I shouldn't." 

She brought herself to question him about his work. He answered the 
questions; he volunteered nothing. She repeated to him the comments of the 
industrialists about the brilliant prospects of d'Anconia Copper under his 
management. "That's true," he said, his voice lifeless. 

In sudden anxiety, not knowing what prompted her, she asked, "Francisco, 
why did you come to New York?" 

He answered slowly, "To see a friend who called for me, " 

"Business ? " 

Looking past her, as if answering a thought of his own, a faint smile of 
bitter amusement on his face, but his voice strangely soft and sad, he 
answered: "Yes." 

It was long past midnight when she awakened in bed by his side. 



No sounds came from the city below. The stillness of the room made life 
seem suspended for a while. Relaxed in happiness and in complete exhaustion, 
she turned lazily to glance at him. He lay on his back, half propped by a 
pillow. She saw his profile against the foggy glow of the night sky in the 
window. He was awake, his eyes were open. He held his mouth closed like a man 
lying in resignation in unbearable pain, bearing it, making no attempt to 
hide it. 

She was too frightened to move. He felt her glance and turned to her. 

He shuddered suddenly, he threw off the blanket, he looked at her naked 
body, then he fell forward and buried his face between her breasts. He held 
her shoulders, hanging onto her convulsively. She heard the words, muffled, 
his mouth pressed to her skin: "I can't give it up! I can't!" 

"What?" she whispered. 

"You. " 

"Why should-" 

"And everything." 

"Why should you give it up?" 

"Dagny! Help me to remain. To refuse. Even though he's right!" 

She asked evenly, 'To refuse what, Francisco?" 

He did not answer, only pressed his face harder against her. 

She lay very still, conscious of nothing but a supreme need of caution. 

His head on her breast, her hand caressing his hair gently, steadily, she 
lay looking up at the ceiling of the room, at the sculptured garlands faintly 
visible in the darkness, and she waited, numb with terror. 

He moaned, "It's right, but it's so hard to do! Oh God, it's so hard!" 

After a while, he raised his head. He sat up. He had stopped trembling. 

"What is it, Francisco?" 

"I can't tell you." His voice was simple, open, without attempt to 
disguise suffering, but it was a voice that obeyed him now. "You're not ready 
to hear it." 

"I want to help you." 

"You can't." 

"You said, to help you refuse." 
"I can't refuse." 

"Then let me share it with you." 
He shook his head. 

He sat looking down at her, as if weighing a question. Then he shook his 
head again, in answer to himself. 

"If I'm not sure I can stand it," he said, and the strange new note in his 
voice was tenderness, "how could you?" 

She said slowly, with effort, trying to keep herself from screaming, 
"Francisco, I have to know." 

"Will you forgive me? I know you're frightened, and it's cruel. But will 
you do this for me— will you let it go, just let it go, and don't ask me 
anything? " 

«I_" 

"That's all you can do for me. Will you?" 
"Yes, Francisco." 

"Don't be afraid for me. It was just this once. It won't happen to me 
again. It will become much easier . . . later." 
"If I could-" 

"No. Go to sleep, dearest," 

It was the first time he had ever used that word. 

In the morning, he faced her openly, not avoiding her anxious glance, but 
saying nothing about it. She saw both serenity and suffering in the calm of 
his face, an expression like a smile of pain, though he was not smiling. 
Strangely, it made him look younger. He did not look like a man bearing 



torture now, but like a man who sees that which makes the torture worth 
bearing . 

She did not question him. Before leaving, she asked only, "When will I see 
you again?" 

He answered, "I don't know. Don't wait for me, Dagny. Next time we meet, 
you will not want to see me. I will have a reason for the things I'll do. But 
I can't tell you the reason and you will be right to damn me. I am not 
committing the contemptible act of asking you to take me on faith. You have 
to live by your own knowledge and judgment. You will damn me. You will be 
hurt. Try not to let it hurt you too much. Remember that I told you this and 
that it was all I could tell you." 

She heard nothing from him or about him for a year. When she began to hear 
gossip and to read newspaper stories, she did not believe, at first, that 
they referred to Francisco d'Anconia. After a while, she had to believe it. 

She read the story of the party he gave on his yacht, in the harbor of 
Valparaiso; the guests wore bathing suits, and an artificial rain of 
champagne and flower petals kept falling upon the decks throughout the night. 

She read the story of the party he gave at an Algerian desert resort; he 
built a pavilion of thin sheets of ice and presented every woman guest with 
an ermine wrap, as a gift to be worn for the occasion, on condition that they 
remove their wraps, then their evening gowns, then all the rest, in tempo 
with the melting of the walls. 

She read the accounts of the business ventures he undertook at lengthy 
intervals; the ventures were spectacularly successful and ruined his 
competitors, but he indulged in them as in an occasional sport, staging a 
sudden raid, then vanishing from the industrial scene for a year or two, 
leaving d'Anconia Copper to the management of his employees. 

She read the interview where he said, "Why should I wish to make money? I 
have enough to permit three generations of descendants to have as good a time 
as I'm having . " 

She saw him once, at a reception given by an ambassador in New York. He 
bowed to her courteously, he smiled, and he looked at her with a glance in 
which no past existed. She drew him aside. She said only, "Francisco, why?" 
"Why— what?" he asked. She turned away. "I warned you," he said. She did not 
try to see him again. 

She survived it. She was able to survive it, because she did not believe 
in suffering. She faced with astonished indignation the ugly fact of feeling 
pain, and refused to let it matter. Suffering was a senseless accident, it 
was not part of life as she saw it. She would not allow pain to become 
important. She had no name for the kind of resistance she offered, for the 
emotion from which the resistance came; but the words that stood as its 
equivalent in her mind were: It does not count —it is not to be taken 
seriously. She knew these were the words, even in the moments when there was 
nothing left within her but screaming and she wished she could lose the 
faculty of consciousness so that it would not tell her that what could not be 
true was true. Not to be taken seriously— an immovable certainty within her 
kept repeating— 

pain and ugliness are never to be taken seriously. 

She fought it. She recovered. Years helped her to reach the day when she 
could face her memories indifferently, then the day when she felt no 
necessity to face them. It was finished and of no concern to her any longer. 

There had been no other men in her life. She did not know whether this had 
made her unhappy. She had had no time to know. She found the clean, brilliant 
sense of life as she wanted it— in her work. Once, Francisco had given her the 
same sense, a feeling that belonged with her work and in her world. The men 
she had met since were like the men she met at her first ball. 



She had won the battle against her memories. But one form of torture 
remained, untouched by the years, the torture of the word "why?" 

Whatever the tragedy he met, why had Francisco taken the ugliest way of 
escape, as ignoble as the way of some cheap alcoholic? The boy she had known 
could not have become a useless coward. An incomparable mind could not turn 
its ingenuity to the invention of melting ballrooms. Yet he had and did, and 
there was no explanation to make it conceivable and to let her forget him in 
peace. She could not doubt the fact of what he had been; she could not doubt 
the fact of what he had become; yet one made the other impossible. At times, 
she almost doubted her own rationality or the existence of any rationality 
anywhere; but this was a doubt which she did not permit to anyone. Yet there 
was no explanation, no reason, no clue to any conceivable reason —and in all 
the days of ten years she had found no hint of an answer. 

No, she thought— as she walked through the gray twilight, past the' 

windows of abandoned shops, to the Wayne-Falkland Hotel— no, there could be 
no answer. She would not seek it. It did not matter now. 

The remnant of violence, the emotion rising as a thin trembling within 
her, was not for the man she was going to see; it was a cry of protest 
against a sacrilege— against the destruction of what had been greatness. 

In a break between buildings, she saw the towers of the Wayne Falkland. 
She felt a slight jolt, in her lungs and legs, that stopped her for an 
instant. Then she walked on evenly. 

By the time she walked through the marble lobby, to the elevator, then 
down the wide, velvet-carpeted, soundless corridors of the Wayne Falkland, 
she felt nothing but a cold anger that grew colder with every step. 

She was certain of the anger when she knocked at his door. She heard his 
voice, answering, "Come in." She jerked the door open and entered. 

Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastian d'Anconia sat on the floor, 
playing marbles. 

Nobody ever wondered whether Francisco d'Anconia was good-looking or not; 
it seemed irrelevant; when he entered a room, it was impossible to look at 
anyone else. His tall, slender figure had an air of distinction, too 
authentic to be modern, and he moved as if he had a cape floating behind him 
in the wind. People explained him by saying that he had the vitality of a 
healthy animal, but they knew dimly that that was not correct. He had the 
vitality of a healthy human being, a thing so rare that no one could identify 
it. He had the power of certainty. 

Nobody described his appearance as Latin, yet the word applied to him, not 
in its present, but in its original sense, not pertaining to Spain, but to 
ancient Rome. His body seemed designed as an exercise in consistency of 
style, a style made of gauntness, of tight flesh, long legs and swift 
movements. His features had the fine precision of sculpture. His hair was 
black and straight, swept back. The suntan of his skin intensified the 
startling color of his eyes: they were a pure, clear blue. His face was open, 
its rapid changes of expression reflecting whatever he felt, as if he had 
nothing to hide. The blue eyes were still and changeless, never giving a hint 
of what he thought. 

He sat on the floor of his drawing room, dressed in sleeping pajamas of 
thin black silk. The marbles spread on the carpet around him were made of the 
semi-precious stones of his native country: carnelian and rock crystal. He 
did not rise when Dagny entered. He sat looking up at her, and a crystal 
marble fell like a teardrop out of his hand. He smiled, the unchanged, 
insolent, brilliant smile of his childhood. 

"Hi, Slug!" 

She heard herself answering, irresistibly, helplessly, happily: "Hi, 
Frisco ! " 



She was looking at his face; it was the face she had known. It bore no 
mark of the kind of life he had led, nor of what she had seen on their last 
night together. There was no sign of tragedy, no bitterness, no tension— only 
the radiant mockery, matured and stressed, the look of dangerously 
unpredictable amusement, and the great, guiltless serenity of spirit. But 
this, she thought, was impossible; this was more shocking than all the rest. 

His eyes were studying her: the battered coat thrown open, half slipping 
off her shoulders, and the slender body in a gray suit that looked like an 
office uniform. 

"If you came here dressed like this in order not to let me notice how 
lovely you are," he said, "you miscalculated. You're lovely. I wish I could 
tell you what a relief it is to see a face that's intelligent though a 
woman's. But you don't want to hear it. That's not what you came here for." 

The words were improper in so many ways, yet were said so lightly that 
they brought her back to reality, to anger and to the purpose of her visit. 
She remained standing, looking down at him, her face blank, refusing him any 
recognition of the personal, even of its power to offend her. She said, "I 
came here to ask you a question." 

"Go ahead." 

"When you told those reporters that you came to New York to witness the 
farce, which farce did you mean?" 

He laughed aloud, like a man who seldom finds a chance to enjoy the 
unexpected. 

"That's what I like about you, Dagny. There are seven million people in 
the city of New York, at present. Out of seven million people, you are the 
only one to whom it could have occurred that I wasn't talking about the Vail 
divorce scandal." 

"What were you talking about?" 

"What alternative occurred to you?" 

"The San Sebastian disaster." 

"That's much more amusing than the Vail divorce scandal, isn't it?" 

She said in the solemn, merciless tone of a prosecutor, "You did it 
consciously, cold-bloodedly and with full intention." 

"Don't you think it would be better if you took your coat off and sat 
down?" 

She knew she had made a mistake by betraying too much intensity. 

She turned coldly, removed her coat and threw it aside. He did not rise to 
help her. She sat down in an armchair. He remained on the floor, at some 
distance, but it seemed as if he were sitting at her feet. 

"What was it I did with full intention?" he asked. 

"The entire San Sebastian swindle." 

"What was my full intention?" 

"That is what I want to know." 

He chuckled, as if she had asked him to explain in conversation a complex 
science requiring a lifetime of study. 

"You knew that the San Sebastian mines were worthless, " she said. 
"You knew it before you began the whole wretched business." 
"Then why did I begin it?" 

"Don't start telling me that you gained nothing. I know it. I know you 
lost fifteen million dollars of your own money. Yet it was done on purpose." 
"Can you think of a motive that would prompt me to do it?" 
"No. It's inconceivable." 

"Is it? You assume that I have a great mind, a great knowledge and a great 
productive ability, so that anything I undertake must necessarily be 
successful. And then you claim that I had no desire to put out my best effort 
for the People's State of Mexico. Inconceivable, isn't it?" 



"You knew, before you bought that property, that Mexico was in the hands 
of a looters' government. You didn't have to start a mining project for 
them. " 

"No, I didn't have to." 

"You didn't give a damn about that Mexican government, one way or another, 
because—" 

"You're wrong about that." 

"—because you knew they'd seize those mines sooner or later. What you were 
after is your American stockholders." 

"That's true." He was looking straight at her, he was not smiling, his 
face was earnest. He added, "That's part of the truth." 

"What's the rest?" 

"It was not all I was after." 

"What else?" 

"That's for you to figure out." 

"I came here because I wanted you to know that I am beginning to 
understand your purpose." 

He smiled. "If you did, you wouldn't have come here." 

"That's true. I don't understand and probably never shall. I am merely 
beginning to see part of it." 
"Which part?" 

"You had exhausted every other form of depravity and sought a new thrill 
by swindling people like Jim and his friends, in order to watch them squirm. 
I don't know what sort of corruption could make anyone enjoy that, but that's 
what you came to New York to see, at the right time." 

"They certainly provided a spectacle of squirming on the grand scale. Your 
brother James in particular." 

"They're rotten fools, but in this case their only crime was that they 
trusted you. They trusted your name and your honor." 

Again, she saw the look of earnestness and again knew with certainty that 
it was genuine, when he said, "Yes. They did. I know it." 

"And do you find it amusing?" 

"No. I don't find it amusing at all." 

He had continued playing with his marbles, absently, indifferently, taking 
a shot once in a while. She noticed suddenly the faultless accuracy of his 
aim, the skill of his hands. He merely flicked his wrist and sent a drop of 
stone shooting across the carpet to click sharply against another drop. She 
thought of his childhood and of the predictions that anything he did would be 
done superlatively. 

"No," he said, "I don't find it amusing. Your brother James and his 
friends knew nothing about the copper-mining industry. They knew nothing 
about making money. They did not think it necessary to learn. They considered 
knowledge superfluous and judgment inessential. They observed that there I 
was in the world and that I made it my honor to know. They thought they could 
trust my honor. One does not betray a trust of this kind, does one?" 

"Then you did betray it intentionally?" 

"That's for you to decide. It was you who spoke about their trust and my 
honor. I don't think in such terms any longer. . . ."He shrugged, adding, "I 
don't give a damn about your brother James and his friends. Their theory was 
not new, it has worked for centuries. But it wasn't foolproof. There is just 
one point that they overlooked. They thought it was safe to ride on my brain, 
because they assumed that the goal of my journey was wealth. All their 
calculations rested on the premise that I wanted to make money. What if I 
didn't?" 

"If you didn't, what did you want?" 

"They never asked me that. Not to inquire about my aims, motives or 
desires is an essential part of their theory." 



"If you didn't want to make money, what possible motive could you have 
had?" 

"Any number of them. For instance, to spend it." 
"To spend money on a certain, total failure?" 

"How was I to know that those mines were a certain, total failure?" 

"How could you help knowing it?" 

"Quite simply. By giving it no thought." 

"You started that project without giving it any thought?" 

"No, not exactly. But suppose I slipped up? I'm only human. I made a 
mistake. I failed. I made a bad job of it." He flicked his wrist; a crystal 
marble shot, sparkling, across the floor and cracked violently against a 
brown one at the other end of the room. 

"I don't believe it," she said. 

"No? But haven't I the right to be what is now accepted as human? 
Should I pay for everybody's mistakes and never be permitted one of my 
own ? " 

"That's not like you." 

"No?" He stretched himself full-length on the carpet, lazily, relaxing. 

"Did you intend me to notice that if you think I did it on purpose, then 
you still give me credit for having a purpose? You're still unable to accept 
me as a bum?" 

She closed her eyes. She heard him laughing; it was the gayest sound hi 
the world. She opened her eyes hastily; but there was no hint of cruelty in 
his face, only pure laughter. 

"My motive, Dagny? You don't think that it's the simplest one of all— 

the spur of the moment?" 

No, she thought, no, that's not true; not if he laughed like that, not if 
he looked as he did. The capacity for unclouded enjoyment, she thought, does 
not belong to irresponsible fools; an inviolate peace of spirit is not the 
achievement of a drifter; to be able to laugh like that is the end result of 
the most profound, most solemn thinking. 

Almost dispassionately, looking at his figure stretched on the carpet at 
her feet, she observed what memory it brought back to her: the black pajamas 
stressed the long lines of his body, the open collar showed a smooth, young, 
sunburned skin— and she thought of the figure in black slacks and shirt 
stretched beside her on the grass at sunrise. She had felt pride then, the 
pride of knowing that she owned his body; she still felt it. She remembered 
suddenly, specifically, the excessive acts of their intimacy; the memory 
should have been offensive to her now, but wasn't. It was still pride, 
without regret or hope, an emotion that had no power to reach her and that 
she had no power to destroy. 

Unaccountably, by an association of feeling that astonished her, she 
remembered what had conveyed to her recently the same sense of consummate joy 
as his. 

"Francisco, " she heard herself saying softly, "we both loved the music of 
Richard Halley. ..." 
"I still love it." 
"Have you ever met him?" 
"Yes. Why?" 

"Do you happen to know whether he has written a Fifth Concerto?" 

He remained perfectly still. She had thought him impervious to shock; he 
wasn't. But she could not attempt to guess why of all the things she had 
said, this should be the first to reach him. It was only an instant; then he 
asked evenly, "What makes you think he has?" 

"Well, has he?" 

"You know that there are only four Halley Concertos." 
"Yes. But I wondered whether he had written another one." 



"He has stopped writing." 
"I know." 

"Then what made you ask that?" 

"Just an idle thought. What is he doing now? Where is he?" 
"I don't know. I haven't seen him for a long time. What made you think 
that there was a Fifth Concerto?" 

"I didn't say there was. I merely wondered about it." 
"Why did you think of Richard Halley just now?" 

"Because"— she felt her control cracking a little— "because my mind can't 
make the leap from Richard Halley' s music to ... to Mrs. 
Gilbert Vail." 

He laughed, relieved. "Oh, that? . . . Incidentally, if you've been 
following my publicity, have you noticed a funny little discrepancy in the 
story of Mrs. Gilbert Vail?" 

"I don't read the stuff." 

"You should. She gave such a beautiful description of last New Year's Eve, 
which we spent together in my villa in the Andes. The moonlight on the 
mountain peaks, and the blood-red flowers hanging on vines in the open 
windows. See anything wrong in the picture?" 

She said quietly, "It's I who should ask you that, and I'm not going to." 

"Oh, I see nothing wrong— except that last New Year's Eve I was in El Paso, 
Texas, presiding at the opening of the San Sebastian Line of Taggart 
Transcontinental, as you should remember, even if you didn't choose to be 
present on the occasion. I had my picture taken with my arms around your 
brother James and the Senor Orren Boyle." 

She gasped, remembering that this was true, remembering also that she had 
seen Mrs. Vail's story in the newspapers. 

"Francisco, what . . . what does that mean?" 

He chuckled. "Draw your own conclusions. . . . Dagny"— his face was 
serious— "why did you think of Halley writing a Fifth Concerto? 

Why not a new symphony or opera? Why specifically a concerto?" 
"Why does that disturb you?" 

"It doesn't." He added softly, "I still love his music, Dagny." Then he 
spoke lightly again. "But it belonged to another age. Our age provides a 
different kind of entertainment." 

He rolled over on his back and lay with his hands crossed under his head, 
looking up as if he were watching the scenes of a movie farce unrolling on 
the ceiling. 

"Dagny, didn't you enjoy the spectacle of the behavior of the People's 
State of Mexico in regard to the San Sebastian Mines? Did you read their 
government's speeches and the editorials in their newspapers? 

They're saying that I am an unscrupulous cheat who has defrauded them. 
They expected to have a successful mining concern to seize. I had no right to 
disappoint them like that. Did you read about the scabby little bureaucrat 
who wanted them to sue me?" 

He laughed, lying flat on his back; his arms were thrown wide on the 
carpet, forming a cross with his body; he seemed disarmed, relaxed and young. 

"It was worth whatever it's cost me. I could afford the price of that 
show. If I had staged it intentionally, I would have beaten the record of the 
Emperor Nero. What's burning a city— compared to tearing the lid off hell and 
letting men see it?" 

He raised himself, picked up a few marbles and sat shaking them absently 
in his hand; they clicked with the soft, clear sound of good stone. She 
realized suddenly that playing with those marbles was not a deliberate 
affectation on his part; it was restlessness; he could not remain inactive 
for long. 



"The government of the People's State of Mexico has issued a 
proclamation, " he said, "asking the people to be patient and put up with 
hardships just a little longer. It seems that the copper fortune of the San 
Sebastian Mines was part of the plans of the central planning council. 

It was to raise everybody's standard of living and provide a roast of pork 
every Sunday for every man, woman, child and abortion in the People's State 
of Mexico. Now the planners are asking their people not to blame the 
government, but to blame the depravity of the rich, because I turned out to 
be an irresponsible playboy, instead of the greedy capitalist I was expected 
to be. How were they to know, they're asking, that I would let them down? 
Well, true enough. How were they to know it?" 

She noticed the way he fingered the marbles in his hand. He was not 
conscious of it, he was looking off into some grim distance, but she felt 
certain that the action was a relief to him, perhaps as a contrast. His 
fingers were moving slowly, feeling the texture of the stones with sensual 
enjoyment. Instead of finding it crude, she found it strangely attractive— 

as if, she thought suddenly, as if sensuality were not physical at all, 
but came from a fine discrimination of the spirit. 

"And that's not all they didn't know," he said. "They're in for some more 
knowledge. There's that housing settlement for the workers of San Sebastian. 
It cost eight million dollars. Steel-frame houses, with plumbing, electricity 
and refrigeration. Also a school, a church, a hospital and a movie theater. A 
settlement built for people who had lived in hovels made of driftwood and 
stray tin cans. My reward for building it was to be the privilege of escaping 
with my skin, a special concession due to the accident of my not being a 
native of the People's State of Mexico. That workers' settlement was also 
part of their plans. 

A model example of progressive State housing. Well, those steel-frame 
houses arc mainly cardboard, with a coating of good imitation shellac, They 
won't stand another year. The plumbing pipes— as well as most of our mining 
equipment— were purchased from the dealers whose main source of supply are the 
city dumps of Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. I'd give those pipes another 
five months, and the electric system about six. The wonderful roads we graded 
up four thousand feet of rock for the People's State of Mexico, will not last 
beyond a couple of winters: they're cheap cement without foundation, and the 
bracing at the bad turns is just painted clapboard. Wait for one good 
mountain slide. The church, I think, will stand. They'll need it." 

"Francisco," she whispered, "did you do it on purpose?" 

He raised his head; she was startled to see that his face had a look of 
infinite weariness. "Whether I did it on purpose," he said, "or through 
neglect, or through stupidity, don't you understand that that doesn't make 
any difference? The same element was missing." 

She was trembling. Against all her decisions and control, she cried, 
"Francisco! If you see what's happening in the world, if you understand all 
the things you said, you can't laugh about it! You, of all men, you should 
fight them! " 

"Whom?" 

"The looters, and those who make world-looting possible. The Mexican 
planners and their kind." 

His smile had a dangerous edge. "No, my dear. It's you that I have to 
fight. " 

She looked at him blankly. "What are you trying to say?" 

"I am saying that the workers' settlement of San Sebastian cost eight 
million dollars," he answered with slow emphasis, his voice hard. "The price 
paid for those cardboard houses was the price that could have bought steel 
structures. So was the price paid for every other item. That money went to 
men who grow rich by such methods. Such men do not remain rich for long. The 



money will go into channels which will carry it, not to the most productive, 
but to the most corrupt. By the standards of our time, the man who has the 
least to offer is the man who wins. That money will vanish in projects such 
as the San Sebastian Mines, " 

She asked with effort, "Is that what you're after?" 

"Yes . " 

"Is that what you find amusing?" 
"Yes." 

"I am thinking of your name, " she said, while another part of her mind was 
crying to her that reproaches were useless. "It was a tradition of your 
family that a d'Anconia always left a fortune greater than the one he 
received . " 

"Oh yes, my ancestors had a remarkable ability for doing the right thing 
at the right time— and for making the right investments. Of course, 
'investment' is a relative term. It depends on what you wish to accomplish. 
For instance, look at San Sebastian. It cost me fifteen million dollars, but 
these fifteen million wiped out forty million belonging to Taggart 
Transcontinental, thirty-five million belonging to stockholders such as James 
Taggart and Orren Boyle, and hundreds of millions which will be lost in 
secondary consequences. That's not a bad return on an investment, is it, 
Dagny?" 

She was sitting straight. "Do you realize what you're saying?" 

"Oh, fully! Shall I beat you to it and name the consequences you were 
going to reproach me for? First, I don't think that Taggart Transcontinental 
will recover from its loss on that preposterous San Sebastian Line. You think 
it will, but it won't. Second, the San Sebastian helped your brother James to 
destroy the Phoenix-Durango, which was about the only good railroad left 
anywhere . " 

"You realize all that?" 

"And a great deal more." 

"Do you"— she did not know why she had to say it, except that the memory of 
the face with the dark, violent eyes seemed to stare at her— 
"do you know Ellis Wyatt?" 
"Sure. " 

"Do you know what this might do to him?" 

"Yes. He's the one who's going to be wiped out next." 

"Do you . . . find that . . . amusing?" 

"Much more amusing than the ruin of the Mexican planners." 

She stood up. She had called him corrupt for years; she had feared it, she 
had thought about it, she had tried to forget it and never think of it again; 
but she had never suspected how far the corruption had gone. 

She was not looking at him; she did not know that she was saying it aloud, 
quoting his words of the past: ". . . who'll do greater honor, you— to Nat 
Taggart, or I— to Sebastian d'Anconia . . ." 

"But didn't you realize that I named those mines in honor of my great 
ancestor? I think it was a tribute which he would have liked." 

It took her a moment to recover her eyesight; she had never known what was 
meant by blasphemy or what one felt on encountering it; she knew it now. 

He had risen and stood courteously, smiling down at her; it was a cold 
smile, impersonal and unrevealing. 

She was trembling, but it did not matter. She did not care what he saw or 
guessed or laughed at. 

"I came here because I wanted to know the reason for what you've done with 
your life," she said tonelessly, without anger. 

"I have told you the reason," he answered gravely, "but you don't want to 
believe it . " 



"I kept seeing you as you were. I couldn't forget it. And that you should 
have become what you are— that does not belong in a rational universe." 
"No? And the world as you see it around you, does?" 

"You were not the kind of man who gets broken by any kind of world" 

"True. " 

"Then-why?" 

He shrugged. "Who is John Gait?" 
"Oh, don't use gutter language!" 

He glanced at her. His lips held the hint of a smile, but his eyes were 
still, earnest and, for an instant, disturbingly perceptive. 
"Why?" she repeated. 

He answered, as he had answered in the night, in this hotel, ten years 
ago, "You're not ready to hear it." 

He did not follow her to the door. She had put her hand on the doorknob 
when she turned— and stopped. He stood across the room, looking at her; it was 
a glance directed at her whole person; she knew its meaning and it held her 
motionless, "I still want to sleep with you," he said. "But I am not a man 
who is happy enough to do it." 

"Not happy enough?" she repeated in complete bewilderment. 

He laughed. "Is it proper that that should be the first thing you'd 
answer?" He waited, but she remained silent. "You want it, too, don't you?" 

She was about to answer "No, " but realized that the truth was worse than 
that. "Yes," she answered coldly, "but it doesn't matter to me that I want 
it. " 

He smiled, in open appreciation, acknowledging the strength she had needed 
to say it. 

But he was not smiling when he said, as she opened the door to leave, "You 
have a great deal of courage, Dagny. Some day, you'll have enough of it." 
"Of what? Courage?" 
But he did not answer. 



CHAPTER VI 
THE NON-COMMERCIAL 



Rearden pressed his forehead to the mirror and tried not to think. That 
was the only way he could go through with it, he told himself. 

He concentrated on the relief of the mirror's cooling touch, wondering how 
one went about forcing one's mind into blankness, particularly after a 
lifetime lived on the axiom that the constant, clearest, most ruthless 
function of his rational faculty was his foremost duty. He wondered why no 
effort had ever seemed beyond his capacity, yet now he could not scrape up 
the strength to stick a few black pearl studs into his starched white shirt 
front . 

This was his wedding anniversary and he had known for three months that 
the party would take place tonight, as Lillian wished. 

He had promised it to her, safe in the knowledge that the party was a long 
way off and that he would attend to it, when the time came, as he attended to 
every duty on his overloaded schedule. Then, during three months of eighteen- 
hour workdays, he had forgotten it happily— until half an hour ago, when, long 
past dinner time, his secretary had entered his office and said firmly, "Your 
party, Mr. Rearden." He had cried, "Good God!" leaping to his feet; he had 
hurried home, rushed up the stairs, started tearing his clothes off and gone 
through the routine of dressing, conscious only of the need to hurry, not of 
the purpose. 

When the full realization of the purpose struck him like a sudden blow, he 
stopped . 

"You don't care for anything but business." He had heard it all his life, 
pronounced as a verdict of damnation. He had always known that business was 
regarded as some sort of secret, shameful cult, which one did not impose on 
innocent laymen, that people thought of it as of an ugly necessity, to be 
performed but never mentioned, that to talk shop was an offense against 
higher sensibilities, that just as one washed machine grease off one's hands 
before coming home, so one was supposed to wash the stain of business off 
one's mind before entering a drawing room. He had never held that creed, but 
he had accepted it as natural that his family should hold it. He took it for 
granted— wordlessly, in the manner of a feeling absorbed in childhood, left 
unquestioned and unnamed— that he had dedicated himself, like the martyr of 
some dark religion, to the service of a faith which was his passionate love, 
but which made him an outcast among men, whose sympathy he was not to expect. 

He had accepted the tenet that it was his duty to give his wife some form 
of existence unrelated to business. But he had never found the capacity to do 
it or even to experience a sense of guilt. He could neither force himself to 
change nor blame her if she chose to condemn him. 

He had given Lillian none of his time for months— :no, he thought, for 
years; for the eight years of their marriage. He had no interest to spare for 
her interests, not even enough to learn just what they were. 

She had a large circle of friends, and he had heard it said that their 
names represented the heart of the country's culture, but he had never had 
time to meet them or even to acknowledge their fame by knowing what 
achievements had earned it. He knew only that he often saw their names on the 
magazine covers on newsstands. If Lillian resented his attitude, he thought, 
she was right. If her manner toward him was objectionable, he deserved it. If 
his family called him heartless, it was true. 

He had never spared himself in any issue. When a problem came up at the 
mills, his first concern was to discover what error he had made; he did not 
search for anyone's fault but his own; it was of himself that he demanded 
perfection. He would grant himself no mercy now; he took the blame. But at 



the mills, it prompted him to action in an immediate impulse to correct the 
error; now, it had no effect. . . . Just a few more minutes, he thought, 
standing against the mirror, his eyes closed. 

He could not stop the thing in his mind that went on throwing words at 
him; it was like trying to plug a broken hydrant with his bare hands. 

Stinging jets, part words, part pictures, kept shooting at his brain. . . 

Hours of it, he thought, hours to spend watching the eyes of the guests 
getting heavy with boredom if they were sober or glazing into an imbecile 
stare if they weren't, and pretend that he noticed neither, and strain to 
think of something to say to them, when he had nothing to say —while he 
needed hours of inquiry to find a successor for the superintendent of his 
rolling mills who had resigned suddenly, without explanation— he had to do it 
at once— men of that sort were so hard to find— and if anything happened to 
break the flow of the rolling mills— it was the Taggart rail that was being 
rolled. ... He remembered the silent reproach, the look of accusation, 
long-bearing patience and scorn, which he always saw in the eyes of his 
family when they caught some evidence of his passion for his business— and the 
futility of his silence, of his hope that they would not think Rearden Steel 
meant as much to him as it did— like a drunkard pretending indifference to 
liquor, among people who watch him with the scornful amusement of their full 
knowledge of his shameful weakness. ... "I heard you last night coming home 
at two in the morning, where were you?" his mother saying to him at the 
dinner table, and Lillian answering, "Why, at the mills, of course," as 
another wife would say, "At the corner saloon." . . . Or Lillian asking him, 
the hint of a wise half-smile on her face, "What were you doing in New York 
yesterday?" "It was a banquet with the boys." "Business?" "Yes." "Of course"— 
and Lillian turning away, nothing more, except the shameful realization that 
he had almost hoped she would think he had attended some sort of obscene stag 
party. . . . 

An ore carrier had gone down in a storm on Lake Michigan, with thousands 
of tons of Rearden ore— those boats were falling apart— if he didn't take it 
upon himself to help them obtain the replacements they needed, the owners of 
the line would go bankrupt, and there was no other line left in operation on 
Lake Michigan. . . . "That nook?" 

said Lillian, pointing to an arrangement of settees and coffee tables in 
their drawing room. "Why, no, Henry, it's not new, but I suppose I should 
feel flattered that three weeks is all it took you to notice it. It's my own 
adaptation of the morning room of a famous French palace —but things like 
that can't possibly interest you, darling, there's no stock market quotation 
on them, none whatever." . . . The order for copper, which he had placed six 
months ago, had not been delivered, the promised date had been postponed 
three tunes— "We can't help it, Mr. Rearden"— he had to find another company to 
deal with, the supply of copper was becoming increasingly uncertain. . . . 
Philip did not smile, when he looked up in the midst of a speech he was 
making to some friend of their mother's, about some organization he had 
joined, but there was something that suggested a smile of superiority in the 
loose muscles of his face when he said, "No, you wouldn't care for this, it's 
not business, Henry, not business at all, it's a strictly non-commercial 
endeavor." . . . That contractor in Detroit, with the job of rebuilding a 
large factory, was considering structural shapes of Rearden Metal —he should 
fly to Detroit and speak to him in person— he should have done it a week ago— 
he could have done it tonight. . . . "You're not listening," said his mother 
at the breakfast table, when his mind wandered to the current coal price 
index, while she was telling him about the dream she'd had last night. 
"You've never listened to a living soul. 



You're not interested in anything but yourself. You don't give a damn 
about people, not about a single human creature on God's earth." 

. . . The typed pages lying on the desk in his office were a report on the 
tests of an airplane motor made of Rearden Metal— perhaps of all things on 
earth, the one he wanted most at this moment was to read it- 
it had lain on his desk, untouched, for three days, he had had no time for 
it— why didn't he do it now and— 

He shook his head violently, opening his eyes, stepping back from the 
mirror . 

He tried to reach for the shirt studs. He saw his hand reaching, instead, 
for the pile of mail on his dresser. It was mail picked as urgent, it had to 
be read tonight, but he had had no time to read it in the office. 

His secretary had stuffed it into his pocket on his way out. He had thrown 
it there while undressing. 

A newspaper clipping fluttered down to the floor. It was an editorial 
which his secretary had marked with an angry stash in red pencil. It was 
entitled "Equalization of Opportunity." He had to read it: there had been too 
much talk about this issue in the last three months, ominously too much, He 
read it, with the sound of voices and forced laughter coming from downstairs, 
reminding him that the guests were arriving, that the party had started and 
that he would face the bitter, reproachful glances of his family when he came 
down . 

The editorial said that at a time of dwindling production, shrinking 
markets and vanishing opportunities to make a living, it was unfair to let 
one man hoard several business enterprises, while others had none; it was 
destructive to let a few corner all the resources, leaving others no chance; 
competition was essential to society, and it was society's duty to see that 
no competitor ever rose beyond the range of anybody who wanted to compete 
with him. The editorial predicted the passage of a bill which had been 
proposed, a bill forbidding any person or corporation to own more than one 
business concern. 

Wesley Mouch, his Washington man, had told Rearden not to worry; the fight 
would be stiff, he had said, but the bill would be defeated. 

Rearden understood nothing about that kind of fight. He left it to Mouch 
and his staff. He could barely find time to skim through the reports from 
Washington and to sign the checks which Mouch requested for the battle. 

Rearden did not believe that the bill would pass. He was incapable of 
believing it. Having dealt with the clean reality of metals, technology, 
production all his life, he had acquired the conviction that one had to 
concern oneself with the rational, not the insane— that one had to seek that 
which was right, because the right answer always won— that the senseless, the 
wrong, the monstrously unjust could not work, could not succeed, could do 
nothing but defeat itself. A battle against a thing such as that bill seemed 
preposterous and faintly embarrassing to him, as if he were suddenly asked to 
compete with a man who calculated steel mixtures by the formulas of 
numerology . 

He had told himself that the issue was dangerous. But the loudest 
screaming of the most hysterical editorial roused no emotion in him— 

while a variation of a decimal point in a laboratory report on a test of 
Rearden Metal made him leap to his feet in eagerness or apprehension. 

He had no energy to spare for anything else. 

He crumpled the editorial and threw it into the wastebasket. He felt the 
leaden approach of that exhaustion which he never felt at his job, the 
exhaustion that seemed to wait for him and catch him the moment he turned to 
other concerns. He felt as if he were incapable of any desire except a 
desperate longing for sleep, He told himself that he had to attend the party— 



that his family had the right to demand it of him— that he had to learn to 
like their kind of pleasure, for their sake, not his own. 

He wondered why this was a motive that had no power to impel him. 
Throughout his life, whenever he became convinced that a course of action was 
right, the desire to follow it had come automatically. What was happening to 
him?— he wondered. The impossible conflict of feeling reluctance to do that 
which was right— wasn't it the basic formula of moral corruption? To recognize 
one's guilt, yet feel nothing but the coldest, most profound indifference— 
wasn't it a betrayal of that which had been the motor of his life-course and 
of his pride? 

He gave himself no time to seek an answer. He finished dressing, quickly, 
pitilessly . 

Holding himself erect, his tall figure moving with the unstressed, 
unhurried confidence of habitual authority, the white of a fine handkerchief 
in the breast pocket of his black dinner jacket, he walked slowly down the 
stairs to the drawing room, looking— to the satisfaction of the dowagers who 
watched him— like the perfect figure of a great industrialist. 

He saw Lillian at the foot of the stairs. The patrician lines of a lemon- 
yellow Empire evening gown stressed her graceful body, and she stood like a 
person proudly in control of her proper background. 

He smiled; he liked to see her happy; it gave some reasonable 
justification to the party. 

He approached her— and stopped. She had always shown good taste in her use 
of jewelry, never wearing too much of it. But tonight she wore an 
ostentatious display: a diamond necklace, earrings, rings and brooches. Her 
arms looked conspicuously bare by contrast. On her right wrist, as sole 
ornament, she wore the bracelet of Rearden Metal. The glittering gems made it 
look like an ugly piece of dime-store jewelry. 

When he moved his glance from her wrist to her face, he found her looking 
at him. Her eyes were narrowed and he could not define their expression; it 
was a look that seemed both veiled and purposeful, the look of something 
hidden that flaunted its security from detection. 

He wanted to tear the bracelet off her wrist. Instead, in obedience to her 
voice gaily pronouncing an introduction, he bowed to the dowager who stood 
beside her, his face expressionless. 

"Man? What is man? He's just a collection of chemicals with delusions of 
grandeur," said Dr. Pritchett to a group of guests across the room. 

Dr. Pritchett picked a canape off a crystal dish, held it speared between 
two straight fingers and deposited it whole into his mouth. 

"Man's metaphysical pretensions," he said, "are preposterous. A miserable 
bit of protoplasm, full of ugly little concepts and mean little emotions— and 
it imagines itself important! Really, you know, that is the root of all the 
troubles in the world." 

"But which concepts are not ugly or mean, Professor?" asked an earnest 
matron whose husband owned an automobile factory. 

"None," said Dr. Pritchett, "None within the range of man's capacity." 

A young man asked hesitantly, "But if we haven't any good concepts, how do 
we know that the ones we've got are ugly? I mean, by what standard?" 

"There aren't any standards." 

This silenced his audience. 

"The philosophers of the past were superficial," Dr. Pritchett went on. 
"It remained for our century to redefine the purpose of philosophy. 

The purpose of philosophy is not to help men find the meaning of life, but 
to prove to them that there isn't any." 

An attractive young woman, whose father owned a coal mine, asked 
indignantly, "Who can tell us that?" 



"I am trying to," said Dr. Pritchett. For the last three years, he had 
been head of the Department of Philosophy at the Patrick Henry University. 

Lillian Rearden approached, her jewels glittering under the lights. 

The expression on her face was held to the soft hint of a smile, set and 
faintly suggested, like the waves of her hair. 

"It is this insistence of man upon meaning that makes him so difficult, " 
said Dr. Pritchett. "Once he realizes that he is of no importance whatever in 
the vast scheme of the universe, that no possible significance can be 
attached to his activities, that it does not matter whether he lives or dies, 
he will become much more . . . tractable." 

He shrugged and reached for another canape", A businessman said uneasily, 
"What I asked you about, Professor, was what you thought about the 
Equalization of Opportunity Bill." 

"Oh, that?" said Dr. Pritchett. "But I believe I made it clear that I am 
in favor of it, because I am in favor of a free economy. A free economy 
cannot exist without competition. Therefore, men must be forced to compete. 
Therefore, we must control men in order to force them to be free." 

"But, look . . . isn't that sort of a contradiction?" 

"Not in the higher philosophical sense. You must learn to see beyond the 
static definitions of old-fashioned thinking. Nothing is static in the 
universe. Everything is fluid." 

"But it stands to reason that if—" 

"Reason, my dear fellow, is the most naive of all superstitions. That, at 
least, has been generally conceded in our age, " 
"But I don't quite understand how we can—" 

"You suffer from the popular delusion of believing that things can be 
understood. You do not grasp the fact that the universe is a solid 
contradiction. " 

"A contradiction of what?" asked the matron. 

"Of itself." 

"How . . . how's that?" 

"My dear madam, the duty of thinkers is not to explain, but to demonstrate 
that nothing can be explained." 

"Yes, of course . . . only . , , " 

"The purpose of philosophy is not to seek knowledge, but to prove that 
knowledge is impossible to man." 

"But when we prove it," asked the young woman, "what's going to be left?" 
"Instinct," said Dr. Pritchett reverently. 

At the other end of the room, a group was listening to Balph Eubank. He 
sat upright on the edge of an armchair, in order to counteract the appearance 
of his face and figure, which had a tendency to spread if relaxed. 

"The literature of the past," said Balph Eubank, "was a shallow fraud. It 
whitewashed life in order to please the money tycoons whom it served. 
Morality, free will, achievement, happy endings, and man as some sort of 
heroic being— all that stuff is laughable to us. Our age has given depth to 
literature for the first time, by exposing the real essence of life, " 

A very young girl in a white evening gown asked timidly, "What is the real 
essence of life, Mr. Eubank?" 

"Suffering," said Balph Eubank. "Defeat and suffering." 

"But . . . but why? People are happy . . . sometimes . . . aren't they?" 

"That is a delusion of those whose emotions are superficial." 

The girl blushed. A wealthy woman who had inherited an oil refinery, asked 
guiltily, "What should we do to raise the people's literary taste, Mr. 
Eubank?" 

"That is a great social problem," said Balph Eubank. He was described as 
the literary leader of the age, but had never written a book that sold more 



than three thousand copies. "Personally, I believe that an Equalization of 
Opportunity Bill applying to literature would be the solution." 

"Oh, do you approve of that Bill for industry? I'm not sure I know what to 
think of it." 

"Certainly, I approve of it. Our culture has sunk into a bog of 
materialism. Men have lost all spiritual values in their pursuit of material 
production and technological trickery. They're too comfortable. They will 
return to a nobler life if we teach them to bear privations. So we ought to 
place a limit upon their material greed." 

"I hadn't thought of it that way," said the woman apologetically. 

"But how are you going to work an Equalization of Opportunity Bill for 
literature, Ralph?" asked Mort Liddy. "That's a new one on me." 

"My name is Balph, " said Eubank angrily. "And it's a new one on you 
because it's my own idea." 

"Okay, okay, I'm not quarreling, am I? I'm just asking." Mort Liddy 
smiled. He spent most of his time smiling nervously. He was a composer who 
wrote old-fashioned scores for motion pictures, and modern symphonies for 
sparse audiences. 

"It would work very simply," said Balph Eubank. "There should be a law 
limiting the sale of any book to ten thousand copies. This would throw the 
literary market open to new talent, fresh ideas and non-commercial writing. 
If people were forbidden to buy a million copies of the same piece of trash, 
they would be forced to buy better books." 

"You've got something there," said Mort Liddy. "But wouldn't it be kinda 
tough on the writers' bank accounts?" 

"So much the better. Only those whose motive is not money-making should be 
allowed to write." 

"But, Mr. Eubank," asked the young girl in the white dress, "what if more 
than ten thousand people want to buy a certain book?" 
"Ten thousand readers is enough for any book." 
"That's not what I mean. I mean, what if they want it?" 
"That is irrelevant." 

"But if a book has a good story which—" 

"Plot is a primitive vulgarity in literature, " said Balph Eubank 
contemptuously. 

Dr. Pritchett, on his way across the room to the bar, stopped to say, 
"Quite so. Just as logic is a primitive vulgarity in philosophy." 

"Just as melody is a primitive vulgarity in music, " said Mort Liddy. 

"What's all this noise?" asked Lillian Rearden, glittering to a stop 
beside them. 

"Lillian, my angel," Balph Eubank drawled, "did I tell you that I'm 
dedicating my new novel to you?" 
"Why. thank you, darling." 

"What is the name of your new novel?" asked the wealthy woman. 
"The Heart Is a Milkman." 
"What is it about?" 
"Frustration . " 

"But, Mr. Eubank," asked the young girl in the white dress, blushing 
desperately, "if everything is frustration, what is there to live for?" 
"Brother-love, " said Balph Eubank grimly. 

Bertram Scudder stood slouched against the bar. His long, thin face looked 
as if it had shrunk inward, with the exception of his mouth and eyeballs, 
which were left to protrude as three soft globes. He was the editor of a 
magazine called The Future and he had written an article on Hank Rearden, 
entitled "The Octopus." 

Bertram Scudder picked up his empty glass and shoved it silently toward 
the bartender, to be refilled. He took a gulp from his fresh drink, noticed 



the empty glass in front of Philip Rearden, who stood beside him, and jerked 
his thumb in a silent command to the bartender. He ignored the empty glass in 
front of Betty Pope, who stood at Philip's other side. 

"Look, bud, " said Bertram Scudder, his eyeballs focused approximately in 
the direction of Philip, "whether you like it or not, the Equalization of 
Opportunity Bill represents a great step forward." 

"What made you think that I did not like it, Mr. Scudder?" Philip asked 
humbly . 

"Well, it's going to pinch, isn't it? The long arm of society is going to 
trim a little off the hors d'oeuvres bill around here." He waved his hand at 
the bar. 

"Why do you assume that I object to that?" 

"You don't?" Bertram Scudder asked without curiosity. 

"I don't!" said Philip hotly. "I have always placed the public good above 
any personal consideration. I have contributed my time and money to Friends 
of Global Progress in their crusade for the Equalization of Opportunity Bill. 
I think it is perfectly unfair that one man should get all the breaks and 
leave none to others." 

Bertram Scudder considered him speculatively, but without particular 
interest. "Well, that's quite unusually nice of you," he said. 

"Some people do take moral issues seriously, Mr. Scudder," said Philip, 
with a gentle stress of pride in his voice. 

"What's he talking about, Philip?" asked Betty Pope. "We don't know 
anybody who owns more than one business, do we?" 

"Oh, pipe down!" said Bertram Scudder, his voice bored. 

"I don't see why there's so much fuss about that Equalization of 
Opportunity Bill, " said Betty Pope aggressively, in the tone of an expert on 
economics. "I don't see why businessmen object to it. It's to their own 
advantage. If everybody else is poor, they won't have any market for their 
goods. But if they stop being selfish and share the goods they've hoarded— 
they'll have a chance to work hard and produce some more." 

"I do not see why industrialists should be considered at all," said 
Scudder. "When the masses are destitute and yet there are goods available, 
it's idiotic to expect people to be stopped by some scrap of paper called a 
property deed. Property rights are a superstition. One holds property only by 
the courtesy of those who do not seize it. The people can seize it at any 
moment. If they can, why shouldn't they?" 

"They should," said Claude Slagenhop. "They need it. Need is the only 
consideration. If people are in need, we've got to seize things first and 
talk about it afterwards." 

Claude Slagenhop had approached and managed to squeeze himself between 
Philip and Scudder, shoving Scudder aside imperceptibly. 

Slagenhop was not tall or heavy, but he had a square, compact bulk, and a 
broken nose. He was the president of Friends of Global Progress. 

"Hunger won't wait," said Claude Slagenhop. "Ideas are just hot air. 

An empty belly is a solid fact. I've said in all my speeches that it's not 
necessary to talk too much. Society is suffering for lack of business 
opportunities at the moment, so we've got the right to seize such 
opportunities as exist. Right is whatever 's good for society." 

"He didn't dig that ore single-handed, did he?" cried Philip suddenly, his 
voice shrill. "He had to employ hundreds of workers. They did it. 

Why does he think he's so good?" 

The two men looked at him, Scudder lifting an eyebrow, Slagenhop without 
expression . 

"Oh, dear me!" said Betty Pope, remembering. 

Hank Rearden stood at a window in a dim recess at the end of the drawing 
room. He hoped no one would notice him for a few minutes. 



He had just escaped from a middle-aged woman who had been telling him 
about her psychic experiences. He stood, looking out. Far in the distance, 
the red glow of Rearden Steel moved in the sky. He watched it for a moment's 
relief . 

He turned to look at the drawing room. He had never liked his house; it 
had been Lillian's choice. But tonight, the shifting colors of the evening 
dresses drowned out the appearance of the room and gave it an air of 
brilliant gaiety. He liked to see people being gay, even though he did not 
understand this particular manner of enjoyment. 

He looked at the flowers, at the sparks of light on the crystal glasses, 
at the naked arms and shoulders of women. There was a cold wind outside, 
sweeping empty stretches of land. He saw the thin branches of a tree being 
twisted, like arms waving in an appeal for help. 

The tree stood against the glow of the mills. 

He could not name his sudden emotion. He had no words to state its cause, 
its quality, its meaning. Some part of it was joy, but it was solemn like the 
act of baring one's head— he did not know to whom. 

When he stepped back into the crowd, he was smiling. But the smile 
vanished abruptly; he saw the entrance of a new guest: it was Dagny Taggart. 

Lillian moved forward to meet her, studying her with curiosity. They had 
met before, on infrequent occasions, and she found it strange to see Dagny 
Taggart wearing an evening gown. It was a black dress with a bodice that fell 
as a cape over one arm and shoulder, leaving the other bare; the naked 
shoulder was the gown's only ornament. Seeing her in the suits she wore, one 
never thought of Dagny Taggart ' s body. The black dress seemed excessively 
revealing— because it was astonishing to discover that the lines of her 
shoulder were fragile and beautiful, and that the diamond band on the wrist 
of her naked arm gave her the most feminine of all aspects: the look of being 
chained . 

"Miss Taggart, it is such a wonderful surprise to see you here, " said 
Lillian Rearden, the muscles of her face performing the motions of a smile. 
"I had not really dared to hope that an invitation' from me would take you 
away from your ever so much weightier concerns. Do permit me to feel 
flattered. " 

James Taggart had entered with his sister. Lillian smiled at him, in the 
manner of a hasty postscript, as if noticing him for the first time. 

"Hello, James. That's your penalty for being popular— one tends to lose 
sight of you in the surprise of seeing your sister." 

"No one can match you in popularity, Lillian, " he answered, smiling 
thinly, "nor ever lose sight of you." 

"Me? Oh, but I am quite resigned to taking second place in the shadow of 
my husband. I am humbly aware that the wife of a great man has to be 
contented with reflected glory— don't you think so, Miss Taggart?" 

"No," said Dagny, "I don't." 

"Is this a compliment or a reproach, Miss Taggart? But do forgive me if I 
confess I'm helpless. Whom may I present to you? I'm afraid I have nothing 
but writers and artists to offer, and they wouldn't interest you, I'm sure." 

"I'd like to find Hank and say hello to him." 

"But of course. James, do you remember you said you wanted to meet Balph 
Eubank?— oh yes, he's here— I'll tell him that I heard you rave about his last 
novel at Mrs. Whitcomb's dinner!" 

Walking across the room, Dagny wondered why she had said that she wanted 
to find Hank Rearden, what had prevented her from admitting that she had seen 
him the moment she entered. 

Rearden stood at the other end of the long room, looking at her. 

He watched her as she approached, but he did not step forward to meet her. 

"Hello, Hank." 



"Good evening." 

He bowed, courteously, impersonally, the movement of his body matching the 
distinguished formality of his clothes. He did not smile. 
"Thank you for inviting me tonight," she said gaily. 
"I cannot claim that I knew you were coming." 

"Oh? Then I'm glad that Mrs. Rearden thought of me. I wanted to make an 
exception . " 

"An exception?" 

"I don't go to parties very often." 

"I am pleased that you chose this occasion as the exception." He did not 
add "Miss Taggart, " but it sounded as if he had. 

The formality of his manner was so unexpected that she was unable to 
adjust to it. "I wanted to celebrate," she said. 

"To celebrate my wedding anniversary?" 

"Oh, is it your wedding anniversary? I didn't know. My congratulations, 
Hank. " 

"What did you wish to celebrate?" 

"I thought I'd permit myself a rest. A celebration of my own— in your honor 
and mine . " 

"For what reason?" 

She was thinking of the new track on the rocky grades of the Colorado 
mountains, growing slowly toward the distant goal of the Wyatt oil fields. 
She was seeing the greenish-blue glow of the rails on the frozen ground, 
among the dried weeds, the naked boulders, the rotting shanties of half- 
starved settlements. 

"In honor of the first sixty miles of Rearden Metal track," she answered. 

"I appreciate it." The tone of his voice was the one that would have been 
proper if he had said, "I've never heard of it." 

She found nothing else to say. She felt as if she were speaking to a 
stranger . 

"Why, Miss Taggart!" a cheerful voice broke their silence. "Now this is 
what I mean when I say that Hank Rearden can achieve any miracle!" 

A businessman whom they knew had approached, smiling at her in delighted 
astonishment. The three of them had often held emergency conferences about 
freight rates and steel deliveries. Now he looked at her, his face an open 
comment on the change in her appearance, the change, she thought, which 
Rearden had not noticed. 

She laughed, answering the man's greeting, giving herself no time to 
recognize the unexpected stab of disappointment, the unadmitted thought that 
she wished she had seen this look on Rearden 's face, instead. She exchanged a 
few sentences with the man. When she glanced around, Rearden was gone. 

"So that is your famous sister?" said Balph Eubank to James Taggart, 
looking at Dagny across the room. 

"I was not aware that my sister was famous," said Taggart, a faint bite in 
his voice. 

"But, my good man, she's an unusual phenomenon in the field of economics, 
so you must expect people to talk about her. Your sister is a symptom of the 
illness of our century. A decadent product of the machine age. Machines have 
destroyed man's humanity, taken him away from the soil, robbed him of his 
natural arts, killed his soul and turned him into an insensitive robot. 
There's an example of it— a woman who runs a railroad, instead of practicing 
the beautiful craft of the handloom and bearing children." 

Rearden moved among the guests, trying not to be trapped into 
conversation. He looked at the room; he saw no one he wished to approach. 

"Say, Hank Rearden, you're not such a bad fellow at all when seen close up 
in the lion's own den. You ought to give us a press conference once in a 
while, you'd win us over." 



Rearden turned and looked at the speaker incredulously. It was a young 
newspaperman of the seedier sort, who worked on a radical tabloid. The 
offensive familiarity of his manner seemed to imply that he chose to be rude 
to Rearden because he knew that Rearden should never have permitted himself 
to associate with a man of his kind. 

Rearden would not have allowed him inside the mills; but the man was 
Lillian's guest; he controlled himself; he asked dryly, "What do you want?" 

"You're not so bad. You've got talent. Technological talent. But, of 
course, I don't agree with you about Rearden Metal." 

"I haven't asked you to agree." 

"Well, Bertram Scudder said that your policy—" the man started 
belligerently, pointing toward the bar, but stopped, as if he had slid 
farther than he intended. 

Rearden looked at the untidy figure slouched against the bar. Lillian had 
introduced them, but he had paid no attention to the name. He turned sharply 
and walked off, in a manner that forbade the young bum to tag him. 

Lillian glanced up at his face, when Rearden approached her in the midst 
of a group, and, without a word, stepped aside where they could not be heard. 

"Is that Scudder of The Future?" he asked, pointing. 

"Why, yes." 

He looked at her silently, unable to begin to believe it, unable to find 
the lead of a thought with which to begin to understand. Her eyes were 
watching him. 

"How could you invite him here?" he asked. 

"Now, Henry, don't let's be ridiculous. You don't want to be narrow 
minded, do you? You must learn to tolerate the opinions of others and respect 
their right of free speech." 

"In my house?" 

"Oh, don't be stuffy!" 

He did not speak, because his consciousness was held, not by coherent 
statements, but by two pictures that seemed to glare at him insistently. 

He saw the article, "The Octopus," by Bertram Scudder, which was not an 
expression of ideas, but a bucket of slime emptied in public— an article that 
did not contain a single fact, not even an invented one, but poured a stream 
of sneers and adjectives in which nothing was clear except the filthy malice 
of denouncing without considering proof necessary. And he saw the lines of 
Lillian's profile, the proud purity which he had sought in marrying her. 

When he noticed her again, he realized that the vision of her profile was 
in his own mind, because she was turned to him full-face, watching him. In 
the sudden instant of returning to reality, he thought that what he saw in 
her eyes was enjoyment. But in the next instant he reminded himself that he 
was sane and that this was not possible. 

"It's the first time you've invited that . . ." he used an obscene word 
with unemotional precision, "to my house. It's the last." 

"How dare you use such—" 

"Don't argue, Lillian. If you do, I'll throw him out right now." 

He gave her a moment to answer, to object, to scream at him if she wished. 
She remained silent, not looking at him, only her smooth cheeks seemed 
faintly drawn inward, as if deflated. 

Moving blindly away through the coils of lights, voices and perfume, he 
felt a cold touch of dread. He knew that he should think of Lillian and find 
the answer to the riddle of her character, because this was a revelation 
which he could not ignore; but he did not think of her— and he felt the dread 
because he knew that the answer had ceased to matter to him long ago. 

The flood of weariness was starting to rise again. He felt as if he could 
almost see it in thickening waves; it was not within him, but outside, 
spreading through the room. For an instant, he felt as if he were alone, lost 



in a gray desert, needing help and knowing that no help would come, He 
stopped short. In the lighted doorway, the length of the room between them, 
he saw the tall, arrogant figure of a man who had paused for a moment before 
entering. He had never met the man, but of all the notorious faces that 
cluttered the pages of newspapers, this was the one he despised. It was 
Francisco d'Anconia. 

Rearden had never given much thought to men like Bertram Scudder. 

But with every hour of his life, with the strain and the pride of every 
moment when his muscles or his mind had ached from effort, with every step he 
had taken to rise out of the mines of Minnesota and to turn his effort into 
gold, with all of his profound respect for money and for its meaning, he 
despised the squanderer who did not know how to deserve the great gift of 
inherited wealth. There, he thought, was the most contemptible representative 
of the species. 

He saw Francisco d'Anconia enter, bow to Lillian, then walk into the crowd 
as if he owned the room which he had never entered before. 

Heads turned to watch him, as if he pulled them on strings in his wake. 

Approaching Lillian once more, Rearden said without anger, the contempt 
becoming amusement in his voice, "I didn't know you knew that one." 

"I've met him at a few parties." 

"Is he one of your friends, too?" 

"Certainly not!" The sharp resentment was genuine. 
"Then why did you invite him?" 

"Well, you can't give a party— not a party that counts— while he's in this 
country, without inviting him. It's a nuisance if he comes, and a social 
black mark if he doesn't." 

Rearden laughed. She was off guard; she did not usually admit things of 
this kind. "Look," he said wearily, "I don't want to spoil your party. But 
keep that man away from me. Don't come around with introductions. I don't 
want to meet him. I don't know how you'll work that, but you're an expert 
hostess, so work it." 

Dagny stood still when she saw Francisco approaching. He bowed to her as 
he passed by. He did not stop, but she knew that he had stopped the moment in 
his mind. She saw him smile faintly in deliberate emphasis of what he 
understood and did not choose to acknowledge. She turned away. She hoped to 
avoid him for the rest of the evening. 

Balph Eubank had joined the group around Dr. Pritchett, and was saying 
sullenly, ". . . no, you cannot expect people to understand the higher 
reaches of philosophy. Culture should be taken out of the hands of the 
dollar-chasers. We need a national subsidy for literature. It is disgraceful 
that artists are treated like peddlers and that art works have to be sold 
like soap." 

"You mean, your complaint is that they don't sell like soap?" asked 
Francisco d'Anconia. 

They had not noticed him approach; the conversation stopped, as if slashed 
off; most of them had never met him, but they all recognized him at once. 

"I meant—" Balph Eubank started angrily and closed his mouth; he saw the 
eager interest on the faces of his audience, but it was not interest in 
philosophy any longer. 

"Why, hello, Professor!" said Francisco, bowing to Dr. Pritchett. 

There was no pleasure in Dr. Pritchett 's face when he answered the 
greeting and performed a few introductions. 

"We were just discussing a most interesting subject," said the earnest 
matron. "Dr. Pritchett was telling us that nothing is anything." 

"He should, undoubtedly, know more than anyone else about that, " 

Francisco answered gravely. 



"I wouldn't have supposed that you knew Dr. Pritchett so well, Senor 
d'Anconia," she said, and wondered why the professor looked displeased by her 
remark . 

"I am an alumnus of the great school that employs Dr. Pritchett at 
present, the Patrick Henry University. But I studied under one of his 
predecessors— Hugh Akston." 

"Hugh Akston!" the attractive young woman gasped. "But you couldn't have, 
Senor d'Anconia! You're not old enough. I thought he was one of those great 
names of ... of the last century." 

"Perhaps in spirit, madame . Not in fact." 

"But I thought he died years ago." 

"Why, no. He is still alive." 

"Then why don't we ever hear about him any more?" 
"He retired, nine years ago." 

"Isn't it odd? When a politician or a movie star retires, we read front 
page stories about it. But when a philosopher retires, people do not even 
notice it." 

"They do, eventually." 

A young man said, astonished, "I thought Hugh Akston was one of those 
classics that nobody studied any more, except in histories of philosophy. I 
read an article recently which referred to him as the last of the great 
advocates of reason." 

"Just what did Hugh Akston teach?" asked the earnest matron. 

Francisco answered, "He taught that everything is something." 

"Your loyalty to your teacher is laudable, Senior d'Anconia," said Dr. 

Pritchett dryly. "May we take it that you are an example of the practical 
results of his teaching?" 

"I am." 

James Taggart had approached the group and was waiting to be noticed. 
"Hello, Francisco." 
"Good evening, James." 

"What a wonderful coincidence, seeing you here! I've been very anxious to 
speak to you." 

"That's new. You haven't always been." 

"Now you're joking, just like in the old days." Taggart was moving slowly, 
as if casually, away from the group, hoping to draw Francisco after him. "You 
know that there's not a person in this room who wouldn't love to talk to 
you . " 

"Really? I ' d be inclined to suspect the opposite." Francisco had followed 
obediently, but stopped within hearing distance of the others. 

"I have tried in every possible way to get in touch with you, " said 
Taggart, "but . . . but circumstances didn't permit me to succeed." 

"Are you trying to hide from me the fact that I refused to see you?" 

"Well . . . that is . , .1 mean, why did you refuse?" 

"I couldn't imagine what you wanted to speak to me about." 

"The San Sebastian Mines, of course!" Taggart's voice rose a little. 

"Why, what about them?" 

"But . . . Now, look, Francisco, this is serious. It's a disaster, an 
unprecedented disaster— and nobody can make any sense out of it. I don't know 
what to think. I don't understand it at all. I have a right to know." 

"A right? Aren't you being old-fashioned, James? But what is it you want 
to know?" 

"Well, first of all, that nationalization— what are you going to do about 
it?" 

"Nothing. " 
"Nothing? ! " 



"But surely you don't want me to do anything about it. My mines and your 
railroad were seized by the will of the people. You wouldn't want me to 
oppose the will of the people, would you?" 

"Francisco, this is not a laughing matter!" 

"I never thought it was." 

"I'm entitled to an explanation! You owe your stockholders an account of 
the whole disgraceful affair! Why did you pick a worthless mine? Why did you 
waste all those millions? What sort of rotten swindle was It?" 

Francisco stood looking at him in polite astonishment. "Why, James," 

he said, "I thought you would approve of it." 

"Approve? ! " 

"I thought you would consider the San Sebastian Mines as the practical 
realization of an ideal of the highest moral order. Remembering that you and 
I have disagreed so often in the past, I thought you would be gratified to 
see me acting in accordance with your principles." 

"What are you talking about?" 

Francisco shook his head regretfully. "I don't know why you should call my 
behavior rotten. I thought you would recognize it as an honest effort to 
practice what the whole world is preaching. Doesn't everyone believe that it 
is evil to be selfish? I was totally selfless in regard to the San Sebastian 
project. Isn't it evil to pursue a personal interest? I had no personal 
interest in it whatever. Isn't it evil to work for profit? I did not work for 
profit— I took a loss. Doesn't everyone agree that the purpose and 
justification of an industrial enterprise are not production, but the 
livelihood of its employees? The San Sebastian Mines were the most eminently 
successful venture in industrial history: they produced no copper, but they 
provided a livelihood for thousands of men who could not have achieved, in a 
lifetime, the equivalent of what they got for one day's work, which they 
could not do. Isn't it generally agreed that an owner is a parasite and an 
exploiter, that it is the employees who do all the work and make the product 
possible? I did not exploit anyone. I did not burden the San Sebastian Mines 
with my useless presence; I left them in the hands of the men who count. I 
did not pass judgment on the value of that property. I turned it over to a 
mining specialist. He was not a very good specialist, but he needed the job 
very badly. Isn't it generally conceded that when you hire a man for a job, 
it is his need that counts, not his ability? Doesn't everyone believe that in 
order to get the goods, all you have to do is need them? I have carried out 
every moral precept of our age. I expected gratitude and a citation of honor. 
I do not understand why I am being damned." 

In the silence of those who had listened, the sole comment was the shrill, 
sudden giggle of Betty Pope: she had understood nothing, but she saw the look 
of helpless fury on James Taggart ' s face. 

People were looking at Taggart, expecting an answer. They were indifferent 
to the issue, they were merely amused by the spectacle of someone's 
embarrassment. Taggart achieved a patronizing smile. 

"You don't expect me to take this seriously?" he asked. 

"There was a time, " Francisco answered, "when I did not believe that 
anyone could take it seriously. I was wrong." 

"This is outrageous!" Taggart's voice started to rise. "It's perfectly 
outrageous to treat your public responsibilities with such thoughtless 
levity!" He turned to hurry away. 

Francisco shrugged, spreading his hands. "You see? I didn't think you 
wanted to speak to me." 

Rearden stood alone, far at the other end of the room. Philip noticed him, 
approached and waved to Lillian, calling her over. 



"Lillian, I don't think that Henry is having a good time," he said, 
smiling; one could not tell whether the mockery of his smile was directed at 
Lillian or at Rearden. "Can't we do something about it?" 

"Oh, nonsense!" said Rearden. 

"I wish I knew what to do about it, Philip," said Lillian. "I've always 
wished Henry would learn to relax. He's so grimly serious about everything. 
He's such a rigid Puritan. I've always wanted to see him drunk, just once. 
But I've given up. What would you suggest?" 

"Oh, I don't know! But he shouldn't be standing around all by himself." 

"Drop it," said Rearden. While thinking dimly that he did not want to hurt 
their feelings, he could not prevent himself from adding, "You don't know how 
hard I've tried to be left standing all by myself." 

"There— you see?" Lillian smiled at Philip. "To enjoy life and people is 
not so simple as pouring a ton of steel. Intellectual pursuits are not 
learned in the market place." 

Philip chuckled. "It's not intellectual pursuits I'm worried about. 

How sure are you about that Puritan stuff, Lillian? If I were you, I 
wouldn't leave him free to look around. There are too many beautiful women 
here tonight." 

"Henry entertaining thoughts of infidelity? You flatter him, Philip. 
You overestimate his courage." She smiled at Rearden, coldly, for a brief, 
stressed moment, then moved away. 

Rearden looked at his brother. "What in hell do you think you're doing?" 
"Oh, stop playing the Puritan! Can't you take a joke?" 

Moving aimlessly through the crowd, Dagny wondered why she had accepted 
the invitation to this party. The answer astonished her: it was because she 
had wanted to see Hank Rearden. Watching him in the crowd, she realized the 
contrast for the first time. The faces of the others looked like aggregates 
of interchangeable features, every face oozing to blend into the anonymity of 
resembling all, and all looking as if they were melting. Rearden 's face, with 
the sharp planes, the pale blue eyes, the ash-blond hair, had the firmness of 
ice; the uncompromising clarity of its lines made it look, among the others, 
as if he were moving through a fog, hit by a ray of light. 

Her eyes kept returning to him involuntarily. She never caught him 
glancing in her direction. She could not believe that he was avoiding her 
intentionally; there could be no possible reason for it- yet she felt certain 
that he was. She wanted to approach him and convince herself that she was 
mistaken. Something stopped her; she could not understand her own reluctance. 

Rearden bore patiently a conversation with his mother and two ladies whom 
she wished him to entertain with stories of his youth and his struggle. He 
complied, telling himself that she was proud of him in her own way. But he 
felt as if something in her manner kept suggesting that she had nursed him 
through his struggle and that she was the source of his success. He was glad 
when she let him go. Then he escaped once more to the recess of the window. 

He stood there for a while, leaning on a sense of privacy as if it were a 
physical support. 

"Mr. Rearden," said a strangely quiet voice beside him, "permit me to 
introduce myself. My name is d'Anconia." 

Rearden turned, startled; d'Anconia 's manner and voice had a quality he 
had seldom encountered before: a tone of authentic respect. 

"How do you do," he answered. His voice was brusque and dry; but he had 
answered . 

"I have observed that Mrs. Rearden has been trying to avoid the necessity 
of presenting me to you, and I can guess the reason. Would you prefer that I 
leave your house?" 

The action of naming an issue instead of evading it, was so unlike the 
usual behavior of all the men he knew, it was such a sudden, startling 



relief, that Rearden remained silent for a moment, studying d'Anconia's face. 
Francisco had said it very simply, neither as a reproach nor a plea, but in a 
manner which, strangely, acknowledged Rearden 's dignity and his own. 

"No," said Rearden, "whatever else you guessed, I did not say that." 

"Thank you. In that case, you will allow me to speak to you." 

"Why should you wish to speak to me?" 

"My motives cannot interest you at present." 

"Mine is not the sort of conversation that could interest you at all." 

"You are mistaken about one of us, Mr. Rearden, or both. I came to this 
party solely in order to meet you." 

There had been a faint tone of amusement in Rearden ' s voice; now it 
hardened into a hint of contempt. "You started by playing it straight. 

Stick to it." 

"I am." 

"What did you want to meet me for? In order to make me lose money?" 
Francisco looked straight at him. "Yes— eventually . " 
"What is it, this time? A gold mine?" 

Francisco shook his head slowly; the conscious deliberation of the 
movement gave it an air that was almost sadness. "No," he said, "I don't want 
to sell you anything. As a matter of fact, I did not attempt to sell the 
copper mine to James Taggart, either. He came to me for it. You won't." 

Rearden chuckled. "If you understand that much, we have at least a 
sensible basis for conversation. Proceed on that. If you don't have some 
fancy investment in mind, what did you want to meet me for?" 

"In order to become acquainted with you, " 

"That's not an answer. It's just another way of saying the same thing." 
"Not quite, Mr. Rearden." 

"Unless you mean— in order to gain my confidence?" 

"No. I don't like people who speak or think in terms of gaining anybody's 
confidence. If one's actions are honest, one does not need the predated 
confidence of others, only their rational perception. The person who craves a 
moral blank check of that kind, has dishonest intentions, whether he admits 
it to himself or not." 

Rearden 's startled glance at him was like the involuntary thrust of a hand 
grasping for support in a desperate need. The glance betrayed how much he 
wanted to find the sort of man he thought he was seeing. Then Rearden lowered 
his eyes, almost closing them, slowly, shutting out the vision and the need. 
His face was hard; it had an expression of severity, an inner severity 
directed at himself; it looked austere and lonely. 

"All right," he said tonelessly. "What do you want, if it's not my 
confidence? " 

"I want to learn to understand you." 

"What for?" 

"For a reason of my own which need not concern you at present." 
"What do you want to understand about me?" 

Francisco looked silently out at the darkness. The fire of the mills was 
dying down. There was only a faint tinge of red left on the edge of the 
earth, just enough to outline the scraps of clouds ripped by the tortured 
battle of the storm in the sky. Dim shapes kept sweeping through space and 
vanishing, shapes which were branches, but looked as if they were the fury of 
the wind made visible. 

"It's a terrible night for any animal caught unprotected on that plain," 
said Francisco d'Anconia. "This is when one should appreciate the meaning 
of being a man." 

Rearden did not answer for a moment; then he said, as if in answer to 
himself, a tone of wonder in his voice, "Funny . . ." 
"What?" 



"You told me what I was thinking just a while ago . . ." 
"You were?" 

". . . only I didn't have the words for it," 
"Shall I tell you the rest of the words?" 
"Go ahead." 

"You stood here and watched the storm _with the greatest pride one can 
ever feel— because you are able to have summer flowers and half naked women in 
your house on a night like this, in demonstration of your victory over that 
storm. And if it weren't for you, most of those who are here would be left 
helpless at the mercy of that wind in the middle of some such plain." 

"How did you know that?" 

In tune with his question., Rearden realized that it was not his thoughts 
this man had named, but his most hidden, most persona] 

emotion; and that he, who would never confess his emotions to anyone, had 
confessed it in his question. He saw the faintest flicker in Francisco's 
eyes, as of a smile or a check mark. 

"What would you know about a pride of that kind?" Rearden asked sharply, 
as if the contempt of the second question could erase the confidence of the 
first . 

"That is what I felt once, when I was young." 

Rearden looked at him. There was neither mockery nor self-pity in 
Francisco's face; the fine, sculptured planes and the clear, blue eyes held a 
quiet composure, the face was open, offered to any blow, unflinching. 

"Why do you want to talk about it?" Rearden asked, prompted by a moment's 
reluctant compassion. 

"Let us say— by way of gratitude, Mr. Rearden." 

"Gratitude to me?" 

"If you will accept it." 

Rearden's voice hardened. "I haven't asked for gratitude. I don't need 
it. " 

"I have not said you needed it. But of all those whom you are saving from 
the storm tonight, I am the only one who will offer it." 

After a moment's silence, Rearden asked, his voice low with a sound which 
was almost a threat, "What are you trying to do?" 

"I am calling your attention to the nature of those for whom you are 
working . " 

"It would take a man who's never done an honest day's work in his life, to 
think or say that." The contempt in Rearden's voice had a note of relief; he 
had been disarmed by a doubt of his judgment on the character of his 
adversary; now he felt certain once more. "You wouldn't understand it if I 
told you that the man who works, works for himself, even if he does carry the 
whole wretched bunch of you along. Now I'll guess what you're thinking: go 
ahead, say that it's evil, that I'm selfish, conceited, heartless, cruel. I 
am. I don't want any part of that tripe about working for others. I'm not." 

For the first time, he saw the look of a personal reaction in Francisco's 
eyes, the look of something eager and young. "The only thing that's wrong in 
what you said, " Francisco answered, "is that you permit anyone to call it 
evil." In Rearden's pause of incredulous silence, he pointed at the crowd in 
the drawing room. "Why are you willing to carry them?" 

"Because they're a bunch of miserable children who struggle to remain 
alive, desperately and very badly, while I— I don't even notice the burden," 

"Why don't you tell them that?" 

"What?" 

"That you're working for your own sake, not theirs." 
"They know it." 



"Oh yes, they know it. Every single one of them here knows it. But they 
don't think you do. And the aim of all their efforts is to keep you from 
knowing it." 

"Why should I care what they think?" 

"Because it's a battle in which one must make one's stand clear." 
"A battle? What battle? I hold the whip hand. I don't fight the disarmed." 
"Are they? They have a weapon against you. It's their only weapon, but 
it's a terrible one. Ask yourself what it is, some time." 
"Where do you see any evidence of it?" 

"In the unforgivable fact that you're as unhappy as you are." 

Rearden could accept any form of reproach, abuse, damnation anyone chose 
to throw at him; the only human reaction which he would not accept was pity. 
The stab of a coldly rebellious anger brought him back to the full context of 
the moment. He spoke, fighting not to acknowledge the nature of the emotion 
rising within him, "What sort of effrontery are you indulging in? What's your 
motive? " 

"Let us say— to give you the words you need, for the time when you'll need 
them. " 

"Why should you want to speak to me on such a subject?" 
"In the hope that you will remember it." 

What he felt, thought Rearden, was anger at the incomprehensible fact that 
he had allowed himself to enjoy this conversation. He felt a dim sense of 
betrayal, the hint of an unknown danger. "Do you expect me to forget what you 
are?" he asked, knowing that this was what he had forgotten. 

"I do not expect you to think of me at all." 

Under his anger, the emotion which Rearden would not acknowledge remained 
unstated and unthought; he knew it only as a hint of pain. 

Had he faced it, he would have known that he still heard Francisco's voice 
saying, "I am the only one who will offer it ... if you will accept it. . . 
." He heard the words and the strangely solemn inflection of the quiet voice 
and an inexplicable answer of his own, something within him that wanted to 
cry yes, to accept, to tell this man that he accepted, that he needed it— 
though there was no name for what he needed, it was not gratitude, and he 
knew that it was not gratitude this man had meant. 

Aloud, he said, "I didn't seek to talk to you. But you've asked for it and 
you're going to hear it. To me, there's only one form of human depravity— the 
man without a purpose." 

"That is true." 

"I can forgive all those others, they're not vicious, they're merely 
helpless. But you— you ' re the kind who can't be forgiven." 

"It is against the sin of forgiveness that I wanted to warn you." 

"You had the greatest chance in life. What have you done with it? 

If you have the mind to understand all the things you said, how can you 
speak to me at all? How can you face anyone after the sort of irresponsible 
destruction you've perpetrated in that Mexican business?" 

"It is your right to condemn me for it, if you wish." 

Dagny stood by the corner of the window recess, listening. They did not 
notice her. She had seen them together and she had approached, drawn by an 
impulse she could not explain or resist; it seemed crucially important that 
she know what these two men said to each other. 

She had heard their last few sentences. She had never thought it possible 
that she would see Francisco taking a beating. He could smash any adversary 
in any form of encounter. Yet he stood, offering no defense. 

She knew that it was not indifference; she knew his face well enough to 
see the effort his calm cost him— she saw the faint line of a muscle pulled 
tight across his cheek. 



"Of all those who live by the ability of others," said Rearden, "you're 
the one real parasite." 

"I have given you grounds to think so." 

"Then what right have you to talk about the meaning of being a man? You're 
the one who has betrayed it." 

"I am sorry if I have offended you by what you may rightly consider as a 
presumption . " 

Francisco bowed and turned to go. Rearden said involuntarily, not knowing 
that the question negated his anger, that it was a plea to stop this man and 
hold him, "What did you want to learn to understand about me?" 

Francisco turned. The expression of his face had not changed; it was still 
a look of gravely courteous respect. "I have learned it," he answered. 

Rearden stood watching him as he walked off into the crowd. The figures of 
a butler, with a crystal dish, and of Dr. Pritchett, stooping to choose 
another canape, hid Francisco from sight. Rearden glanced out at the 
darkness; nothing could be seen there but the wind. 

Dagny stepped forward, when he came out of the recess; she smiled, openly 
inviting conversation. He stopped. It seemed to her that he had stopped 
reluctantly. She spoke hastily, to break the silence. 

"Hank, why do you have so many intellectuals of the looter persuasion 
here? I wouldn't have them in my house." 

This was not what she had wanted to say to him. But she did not know what 
she wanted to say; never before had she felt herself left wordless in his 
presence . 

She saw his eyes narrowing, like a door being closed. "I see no reason why 
one should not invite them to a party," he answered coldly. 

"Oh, I didn't mean to criticize your choice of guests. But . . . Well, 
I've been trying not to learn which one of them is Bertram Scudder. If I do, 
I'll slap his face." She tried to sound casual, "I don't want to create a 
scene, but I'm not sure I'll be able to control myself. I couldn't believe it 
when somebody told me that Mrs. Rearden had invited him." 

"I invited him." 

"But . . ." Then her voice dropped. "Why?" 

"I don't attach any importance to occasions of this kind." 
"I'm sorry, Hank. I didn't know you were so tolerant. I'm not." 
He said nothing. 

"I know you don't like parties. Neither do I. But sometimes I wonder . . . 
perhaps we're the only ones who were meant to be able to enjoy them." 
"I am afraid I have no talent for it." 

"Not for this. But do you think any of these people are enjoying it? 
They're just straining to be more senseless and aimless than usual. To be 
light and unimportant . . . You know, I think that only if one feels 
immensely important can one feel truly light." 

"I wouldn't know." 

"It's just a thought that disturbs me once in a while. ... I thought it 
about my first ball. ... I keep thinking that parties are intended to be 
celebrations, and celebrations should be only for those who have something to 
celebrate . " 

"I have never thought of it." 

She could not adapt her words to the rigid formality of his manner; she 
could not quite believe it. They had always been at ease together, in his 
office. Now he was like a man in a strait jacket. 

"Hank, look at it. If you didn't know any of these people, wouldn't it 
seem beautiful? The lights and the clothes and all the imagination that went 
to make it possible . . ." She was looking at the room. She did not notice 
that he had not followed her glance. He was looking down at the shadows on 
her naked shoulder, the soft, blue shadows made by the light that fell 



through the strands of her hair. "Why have we left it all to fools? It should 
have been ours . " 

"In what manner?" 

"I don't know . . . I've always expected parties to be exciting and 
brilliant, like some rare drink." She laughed; there was a note of sadness in 
it. "But I don't drink, either. That's just another symbol that doesn't mean 
what it was intended to mean," He was silent. She added, "Perhaps there's 
something that we have missed." 

"I am not aware of it." 

In a flash of sudden, desolate emptiness, she was glad that he had not 
understood or responded, feeling dimly that she had revealed too much, yet 
not knowing what she had revealed. She shrugged, the movement running through 
the curve of her shoulder like a faint convulsion. 

"It's just an old illusion of mine," she said indifferently. "Just a mood 
that comes once every year or two. Let me see the latest steel price index 
and I'll forget all about it." 

She did not know that his eyes were following her, as she walked away from 
him. 

She moved slowly through the room, looking at no one. She noticed a small 
group huddled by the unlighted fireplace. The room was not cold, but they sat 
as if they drew comfort from the thought of a non-existent fire. 

"I do not know why, but I am growing to be afraid of the dark. No, not 
now, only when I am alone. What frightens me is night. Night as such." 

The speaker was an elderly spinster with an air of breeding and 
hopelessness. The three women and two men of the group were well dressed, the 
skin of their faces was smoothly well tended, but they had a manner of 
anxious caution that kept their voices one tone lower than normal and blurred 
the differences of their ages, giving them all the same gray look of being 
spent. It was the look one saw in groups of respectable people everywhere. 
Dagny stopped and listened. 

"But, my dear," one of them asked, "why should it frighten you?" 

"I don't know," said the spinster, "I am not afraid of prowlers or 
robberies or anything of the sort. But I stay awake all night. I fall asleep 
only when I see the sky turning pale. It is very odd. Every evening, when it 
grows dark, I get the feeling that this tune it is final, that daylight will 
not return . " 

"My cousin who lives on the coast of Maine wrote me the same thing, " 
said one of the women. 

"Last night," said the spinster, "I stayed awake because of the shooting. 
There were guns going off all night, way out at sea. There were no flashes. 
There was nothing. Just those detonations, at long intervals, somewhere in 
the fog over the Atlantic." 

"I read something about it in the paper this morning. Coast Guard target 
practice . " 

"Why, no," the spinster said indifferently. "Everybody down on the shore 
knows what it was. It was Ragnar Danneskjold. It was the Coast Guard trying 
to catch him." 

"Ragnar Danneskjold in Delaware Bay?" a woman gasped. 

"Oh, yes. They say it is not the first time." 

"Did they catch him?" 

"No. " 

"Nobody can catch him," said one of the men. 

"The People's State of Norway has offered a million-dollar reward for his 
head. " 

"That's an awful lot of money to pay for a pirate's head." 
"But how are we going to have any order or security or planning in the 
world, with a pirate running loose all over the seven seas?" 



"Do you know what it was that he seized last night?" said the spinster. 
"The big ship with the relief supplies we were sending to the People's 
State of France." 

"How does he dispose of the goods he seizes?" 
"Ah, that— nobody knows." 

"I met a sailor once, from a ship he'd attacked, who'd seen him in person. 
He said that Ragnar Danneskjold has the purest gold hair and the most 
frightening face on earth, a face with no sign of any feeling. If there ever 
was a man born without a heart, he's it— the sailor said." 

"A nephew of mine saw Ragnar Danneskj old ' s ship one night, off the coast 
of Scotland. He wrote me that he couldn't believe his eyes. It was a better 
ship than any in the navy of the People's State of England." 

"They say he hides in one of those Norwegian fjords where neither God nor 
man will ever find him. That's where the Vikings used to hide in the Middle 
Ages . " 

"There's a reward on his head offered by the People's State of Portugal, 
too. And by the People's State of Turkey." 

"They say it's a national scandal in Norway. He comes from one of their 
best families. The family lost its money generations ago, but the name is of 
the noblest. The ruins of their castle are still in existence. 

His father is a bishop. His father has disowned him and excommunicated 
him. But it had no effect." 

"Did you know that Ragnar Danneskjold went to school in this country? 
Sure. The Patrick Henry University." 

"Not really?" 

"Oh yes. You can look it up." 

"What bothers me is . . . You know, I don't like it. I don't like it that 
he's now appearing right here, in our own waters. I thought things like that 
could happen only in the wastelands. Only in Europe. But a big-scale outlaw 
of that kind operating in Delaware in our day and age!" 

"He's been seen off Nantucket, too. And at Bar Harbor. The newspapers have 
been asked not to write about it." 

"Why?" 

"They don't want people to know that the navy can't cope with him." 
"I don't like it. It feels funny. It's like something out of the Dark 
Ages . " 

Dagny glanced up. She saw Francisco d'Anconia standing a few steps away. 
He was looking at her with a kind of stressed curiosity; his eyes were 
mocking . 

"It's a strange world we're living in," said the spinster, her voice low. 

"I read an article," said one of the women tonelessly. "It said that times 
of trouble are good for us. It is good that people are growing poorer. To 
accept privations is a moral virtue." 

"I suppose so," said another, without conviction. 

"We must not worry. I heard a speech that said it is useless to worry or 
to blame anyone. Nobody can help what he does, that is the way things made 
him. There is nothing we can do about anything. We must learn to bear it." 

"What's the use anyway? What is man's fate? Hasn't it always been to hope, 
but never to achieve? The wise man is the one- who does not attempt to hope." 

"That is the right attitude to take." 

"I don't know ... I don't know what is right any more . . . How can we 
ever know?" 

"Oh well, who is John Gait?" 

Dagny turned brusquely and started away from them. One of the women 
followed her. 

"But I do know it, " said the woman, in the soft, mysterious tone of 
sharing a secret. 



"You know what?" 

"I know who is John Gait." 

"Who?" Dagny asked tensely, stopping. 

"I know a man who knew John Gait in person. This man is an old friend of a 
great-aunt of mine. He was there and he saw it happen. Do you know the legend 
of Atlantis, Miss Taggart?" 

"What?" 

"Atlantis . " 

"Why . . . vaguely." 

"The Isles of the Blessed. That is what the Greeks called it, thousands of 
years ago. They said Atlantis was a place where hero-spirits lived in a 
happiness unknown to the rest of the earth. A place which only the spirits of 
heroes could enter, and they reached it without dying, because they carried 
the secret of life within them. Atlantis was lost to mankind, even then. But 
the Greeks knew that it had existed. They tried to find it. Some of them said 
it was underground, hidden in the heart of the earth. But most of them said 
it was an island. A radiant island in the Western Ocean. Perhaps what they 
were thinking of was America. They never found it. For centuries afterward, 
men said it was only a legend. 

They did not believe it, but they never stopped looking for it, because 
they knew that that was what they had to find." 

"Well, what about John Gait?" 

"He found it." 

Dagny' s interest was gone. "Who was he?" 

"John Gait was a millionaire, a man of inestimable wealth. He was sailing 
his yacht one night, in mid-Atlantic, fighting the worst storm ever wreaked 
upon the world, when he found it. He saw it in the depth, where it had sunk 
to escape the reach of men. He saw the towers of Atlantis shining on the 
bottom of the ocean. It was a sight of such kind that when one had seen it, 
one could no longer wish to look at the rest of the earth. John Gait sank his 
ship and went down with his entire crew. They all chose to do it. My friend 
was the only one who survived." 

"How interesting." 

"My friend saw it with his own eyes," said the woman, offended. "It 
happened many years ago. But John Gait's family hushed up the story." 

"And what happened to his fortune? [ don't recall ever hearing of a Gait 
fortune . " 

"It went down with him." She added belligerently, "You don't have to 
believe it." 

"Miss Taggart doesn't," said Francisco d'Anconia. "I do." 

They turned. He had followed them and he stood looking at them with the 
insolence of exaggerated earnestness. 

"Have you ever had faith in anything, Senor d'Anconia?" the woman asked 
angrily . 

"No, madame . " 

He chuckled at her brusque departure. Dagny asked coldly, "What's the 
joke?" 

"The joke's on that fool woman. She doesn't know that she was telling you 
the truth." 

"Do you expect me to believe that?" 
"No. " 

"Then what do you find so amusing?" 

"Oh, a great many things here. Don't you?" 

"No . " 

"Well, that's one of the things I find amusing." 
"Francisco, will you leave me alone?" 



"But I have. Didn't you notice that you were first to speak to me 
tonight?" 

"Why do you keep watching me?" 
"Curiosity . " 
"About what?" 

"Your reaction to the things which you don't find amusing." 
"Why should you care about my reaction to anything?" 

"That is my own way of having a good time, which, incidentally, you are 
not having, are you, Dagny? Besides, you're the only woman worth watching 
here . " 

She stood defiantly still, because the way he looked at her demanded an 
angry escape. She stood as she always did, straight and taut, her head lifted 
impatiently. It was the unfeminine pose of an executive. But her naked 
shoulder betrayed the fragility of the body under the black dress, and the 
pose made her most truly a woman. The proud strength became a challenge to 
someone's superior strength, and the fragility a reminder that the challenge 
could be broken. She was not conscious of it. She had met no one able to see 
it. 

He said, looking down at her body, "Dagny, what a magnificent waste!" 

She had to turn and escape. She felt herself blushing, for the first time 
in years: blushing because she knew suddenly that the sentence named what she 
had felt all evening. 

She ran, trying not to think. The music stopped her. It was a sudden blast 
from the radio. She noticed Mort Liddy, who had turned it on, waving his arms 
to a group of friends, yelling, "That's it! That's it! I want you to hear 
it ! " 

The great burst of sound was the opening chords of Halley's Fourth 
Concerto. It rose in tortured triumph, speaking its denial of pain, its hymn 
to a distant vision. Then the notes broke. It was as if a handful of mud and 
pebbles had been flung at the music, and what followed was the sound of the 
rolling and the dripping. It was Halley's Concerto swung into a popular tune. 
It was Halley's melody torn apart, its holes stuffed with hiccoughs. The 
great statement of joy had become the giggling of a barroom. Yet it was still 
the remnant of Halley' s melody that gave it form; it was the melody that 
supported it like a spinal cord. 

"Pretty good?" Mort Liddy was smiling at his friends, boastfully and 
nervously. "Pretty good, eh? Best movie score of the year. Got me a prize. 
Got me a long-term contract. Yeah, this was my score for Heaven's in Your 
Backyard . " 

Dagny stood, staring at the room, as if one sense could replace another, 
as if sight could wipe out sound. She moved her head in a slow circle, trying 
to find an anchor somewhere. She saw Francisco leaning against a column, his 
arms crossed; he was looking straight at her; he was laughing. 

Don't shake like this, she thought. Get out of here. This was the approach 
of an anger she could not control. She thought: Say nothing. 

Walk steadily. Get out. 

She had started walking, cautiously, very slowly. She heard Lillian's 
words and stopped. Lillian had said it many times this evening, in answer to 
the same question, but it was the first time that Dagny heard it. 

"This?" Lillian was saying, extending her arm with the metal bracelet for 
the inspection of two smartly groomed women. "Why, no, it's not from a 
hardware store, it's a very special gift from my husband. 

Oh, yes, of course it's hideous. But don't you sec? It's supposed to be 
priceless. Of course, I'd exchange it for a common diamond bracelet any time, 
but somehow nobody will offer me one for it, even though it is so very, very 
valuable. Why? My dear, it's the first thing ever made of Rearden Metal." 



Dagny did not see the room. She did not hear the music. She felt the 
pressure of dead stillness against her eardrums. She did not know the moment 
that preceded, or the moments that were to follow. She did not know those 
involved, neither herself, nor Lillian, nor Rearden, nor the meaning of her 
own action. It was a single instant, blasted out of context. She had heard. 
She was looking at the bracelet of green-blue metal. 

She felt the movement of something being torn off her wrist, and she heard 
her own voice saying in the great stillness, very calmly, a voice cold as a 
skeleton, naked of emotion, "If you are not the coward that I think you are, 
you will exchange it." 

On the palm of her hand, she was extending her diamond bracelet to 
Lillian . 

"You're not serious, Miss Taggart?" said a woman's voice. 

It was not Lillian's voice. Lillian's eyes were looking straight at her. 

She saw them. Lillian knew that she was serious. 

"Give me that bracelet, " said Dagny, lifting her palm higher, the diamond 
band glittering across it. 

"This is horrible!" cried some woman. It was strange that the cry stood 
out so sharply. Then Dagny realized that there were people standing around 
them and that they all stood in silence. She was hearing sounds now, even the 
music; it was Halley's mangled Concerto, somewhere far away. 

She saw Rearden 's face. It looked as if something within him were mangled, 
like the music; she did not know by what. He was watching them. 

Lillian's mouth moved into an upturned crescent. It resembled a smile. She 
snapped the metal bracelet open, dropped it on Dagny 's palm and took the 
diamond band. 

"Thank you, Miss Taggart," she said. 

Dagny 's fingers closed about the metal. She felt that; she felt nothing 
else . 

Lillian turned, because Rearden had approached her. He took the diamond 
bracelet from her hand. He clasped it on her wrist, raised her hand to his 
lips and kissed it. 

He did not look at Dagny. 

Lillian laughed, gaily, easily, attractively, bringing the room back to 
its normal mood. 

"You may have it back, Miss Taggart, when you change your mind, " 
she said. 

Dagny had turned away. She felt calm and free. The pressure was gone. The 
need to get out had vanished. 

She clasped the metal bracelet on her wrist. She liked the feel of its 
weight against her skin. Inexplicably, she felt a touch of feminine vanity, 
the kind she had never experienced before: the desire to be seen wearing this 
particular ornament. 

From a distance, she heard snatches of indignant voices: "The most 
offensive gesture I've ever seen. ... It was vicious. . . .I'm glad 
Lillian took her up on it. . . . Serves her right, if she feels like throwing 
a few thousand dollars away. ..." 

For the rest of the evening, Rearden remained by the side of his wife. 

He shared her conversations, he laughed with her friends, he was suddenly 
the devoted, attentive, admiring husband. 

He was crossing the room, carrying a tray with drinks requested by someone 
in Lillian's group— an unbecoming act of informality which nobody had ever 
seen him perform— when Dagny approached him. 

She stopped and looked up at him, as if they were alone in his office. 

She stood like an executive, her head lifted. He looked down at her. In 
the line of his glance, from the fingertips of her one hand to her face, her 
body was naked but for his metal bracelet. 



"I'm sorry, Hank," she said, "but I had to do it." 

His eyes remained expressionless. Yet she was suddenly certain that she 
knew what he felt: he wanted to slap her face. 

"It was not necessary," he answered coldly, and walked on. 

It was very late when Rearden entered his wife's bedroom. She was still 
awake. A lamp burned on her bedside table. 

She lay in bed, propped up on pillows of pale green linen. Her bed jacket 
was pale green satin, worn with the untouched perfection of a window model; 
its lustrous folds looked as if the crinkle of tissue paper still lingered 
among them. The light, shaded to a tone of apple blossoms, fell on a table 
that held a book, a glass of fruit juice, and toilet accessories of silver 
glittering like instruments in a surgeon's case. Her arms had a tinge of 
porcelain. There was a touch of pale pink lipstick on her mouth. She showed 
no sign of exhaustion after the party— no sign of life to be exhausted. The 
place was a decorator's display of a lady groomed for sleep, not to be 
disturbed. 

He still wore his dress clothes; his tie was loose, and a strand of hair 
hung over his face. She glanced at him without astonishment, as if she knew 
what the last hour in his room had done to him. 

He looked at her silently. He had not entered her room for a long time. He 
stood, wishing he had not entered it now. 

"Isn't it customary to talk, Henry?" 

"If you wish." 

"I wish you'd send one of your brilliant experts from the mills to take a 
look at our furnace. Do you know that it went out during the party and Simons 
had a terrible time getting it started again? . . . Mrs. 

Weston says that our best achievement is our cook— she loved the hors 
d'oeuvres. . . . Balph Eubank said a very funny thing about you, he said 
you're a crusader with a factory's chimney smoke for a plume. . . . 

I'm glad you don't like Francisco d'Anconia. I can't stand him." 

He did not care to explain his presence, or to disguise defeat, or to 
admit it by leaving. Suddenly, it did not matter to him what she guessed or 
felt. He walked to the window and stood, looking out. 

Why had she married him?— he thought. It was a question he had not asked 
himself on their wedding day, eight years ago. Since then, in tortured 
loneliness, he had asked it many times. He had found no answer. 

It was not for position, he thought, or for money. She came from an old 
family that had both. Her family's name was not among the most distinguished 
and their fortune was modest, but both were sufficient to let her be included 
in the top circles of New York's society, where he had met her. Nine years 
ago, he had appeared in New York like an explosion, in the glare of the 
success of Rearden Steel, a success that had been thought impossible by the 
city's experts. It was his indifference that made him spectacular. He did not 
know that he was expected to attempt to buy his way into society and that 
they anticipated the pleasure of rejecting him. He had no time to notice 
their disappointment. 

He attended, reluctantly, a few social occasions to which he was invited 
by men who sought his favor. He did not know, but they knew, that his 
courteous politeness was condescension toward the people who had expected to 
snub him, the people who had said that the age of achievement was past. 

It was Lillian's austerity that attracted him— the conflict between her 
austerity and her behavior. He had never liked anyone or expected to be 
liked. He found himself held by the spectacle of a woman who was obviously 
pursuing him but with obvious reluctance, as if against her own will, as if 
fighting a desire she resented. It was she who planned that they should meet, 
then faced him coldly, as if not caring that he knew it. She spoke little; 
she had an air of mystery that seemed to tell him he would never break 



through her proud detachment, and an air of amusement, mocking her own desire 
and his. 

He had not known many women. He had moved toward his goal, sweeping aside 
everything that did not pertain to it in the world and in himself. His 
dedication to his work was like one of the fires he dealt with, a fire that 
burned every lesser element, every impurity out of the white stream of a 
single metal. He was incapable of halfway concerns. 

But there were times when he felt a sudden access of desire, so violent 
that it could not be given to a casual encounter. He had surrendered to it, 
on a few rare occasions through the years, with women he had thought he 
liked. He had been left feeling an angry emptiness— because he had sought an 
act of triumph, though he had not known of what nature, but the response he 
received was only a woman's acceptance of a casual pleasure, and he knew too 
clearly that what he had won had no meaning. He was left, not with a sense of 
attainment, but with a sense of his own degradation. He grew to hate his 
desire. He fought it. He came to believe the doctrine that this desire was 
wholly physical, a desire, not of consciousness, but of matter, and he 
rebelled against the thought that his flesh could be free to choose and that 
its choice was impervious to the will of his mind. He had spent his life in 
mines and mills, shaping matter to his wishes by the power of his brain— and 
he found it intolerable that he should be unable to control the matter of his 
own body. He fought it. He had won his every battle against inanimate nature; 
but this was a battle he lost. 

It was the difficulty of the conquest that made him want Lillian. 

She seemed to be a woman who expected and deserved a pedestal; this made 
him want to drag her down to his bed. To drag her down, were the words in his 
mind; they gave him a dark pleasure, the sense of a victory worth winning. 

He could not understand why— he thought it was an obscene conflict, the 
sign of some secret depravity within him— why he felt, at the same time, a 
profound pride at the thought of granting to a woman the title of his wife. 
The feeling was solemn and shining; it was almost as if he felt that he 
wished to honor a woman by the act of possessing her. 

Lillian seemed to fit the image he had not known he held, had not known he 
wished to find; he saw the grace, the pride, the purity; the rest was in 
himself; he did not know that he was looking at a reflection. 

He remembered the day when Lillian came from New York to his office, of 
her own sudden choice, and asked him to take her through his mills. He heard 
a soft, low, breathless tone— the tone of admiration- 
growing in her voice, as she questioned him about his work and looked at 
the place around her. He looked at her graceful figure moving against the 
bursts of furnace flame, and at the light, swift steps of her high heels 
stumbling through drifts of slag, as she walked resolutely by his side. 

The look in her eyes, when she watched a heat of steel being poured, was 
like his own feeling for it made visible to him. When her eyes moved up to 
his face, he saw the same look, but intensified to a degree that seemed to 
make her helpless and silent. It was at dinner, that evening, that he asked 
her to marry him. 

It took him some time after his marriage before he admitted to himself 
that this was torture. He still remembered the night when he admitted it, 
when he told himself— the veins of his wrists pulled tight as he stood by the 
bed, looking down at Lillian— that he deserved the torture and that he would 
endure it. Lillian was not looking at him; she was adjusting her hair. "May I 
go to sleep now?" she asked. 

She had never objected; she had never refused him anything; she submitted 
whenever he wished. She submitted in the manner of complying with the rule 
that it was, at times, her duty to become an inanimate object turned over to 
her husband's use. 



She did not censure him. She made it clear that she took it for granted 
that men had degrading instincts which constituted the secret, ugly part of 
marriage. She was condescendingly tolerant. She smiled, in amused distaste, 
at the intensity of what he experienced. "It's the most undignified pastime I 
know of, " she said to him once, "but I have never entertained the illusion 
that men are superior to animals." 

His desire for her had died in the first week of their marriage. What 
remained was only a need which he was unable to destroy. He had never entered 
a whorehouse; he thought, at times, that the self-loathing he would 
experience there could be no worse than what he felt when he was driven to 
enter his wife's bedroom. 

He would often find her reading a book. She would put it aside, with a 
white ribbon to mark the pages. When lie lay exhausted, his eyes closed, 
still breathing in gasps, she would turn on the light, pick up the book and 
continue her reading. 

He told himself that he deserved the torture, because he had wished never 
to touch her again and was unable to maintain his decision. He despised 
himself for that. He despised a need which now held no shred of joy or 
meaning, which had become the mere need of a woman's body, an anonymous body 
that belonged to a woman whom he had to forget while he held it. He became 
convinced that the need was depravity. 

He did not condemn Lillian. He felt a dreary, indifferent respect for her. 
His hatred of his own desire had made him accept the doctrine that women were 
pure and that a pure woman was one incapable of physical pleasure. 

Through the quiet agony of the years of his marriage, there had been one 
thought which he would not permit himself to consider; the thought of 
infidelity. He had given his word. He intended to keep it. It was not loyalty 
to Lillian; it was not the person of Lillian that he wished to protect from 
dishonor— but the person of his wife. 

He thought of that now, standing at the window. He had not wanted to enter 
her room. He had fought against it. He had fought, more fiercely, against 
knowing the particular reason why he would not be able to withstand it 
tonight. Then, seeing her, he had known suddenly that he would not touch her. 
The reason which had driven him here tonight was the reason which made it 
impossible for him. 

He stood still, feeling free of desire, feeling the bleak relief of 
indifference to his body, to this room, even to his presence here. He had 
turned away from her, not to see her lacquered chastity. What he thought he 
should feel was respect; what he felt was revulsion. 

". . . but Dr. Pritchett said that our culture is dying because our 
universities have to depend on the alms of the meat packers, the steel 
puddlers and the purveyors of breakfast cereals." 

Why had she married him?— he thought. That bright, crisp voice was not 
talking at random. She knew why he had come here. She knew what it would do 
to him to see her pick up a silver buffer and go on talking gaily, polishing 
her fingernails. She was talking about the party. 

But she did not mention Bertram Scudder— or Dagny Taggart. 

What had she sought in marrying him? He felt the presence of some cold, 
driving purpose within her— but found nothing to condemn. She had never tried 
to use him. She made no demands on him. She found no satisfaction in the 
prestige of industrial power— she spurned it— she preferred her own circle of 
friends. She was not after money— she spent little— she was indifferent to the 
kind of extravagance he could have afforded. He had no right to accuse her, 
he thought, or ever to break the bond. She was a woman of honor in their 
marriage. She wanted nothing material from him. 

He turned and looked at her wearily. 

"Next time you give a party," he said, "stick to your own crowd. 



Don't invite what you think are my friends. I don't care to meet them 
socially . " 

She laughed, startled and pleased. "I don't blame you, darling," she said. 
He walked out, adding nothing else. 

What did she want from him?— he thought. What was she after? In the 
universe as he knew it. There was no answer. 



CHAPTER VII 
THE EXPLOITERS AND THE EXPLOITED 



The rails rose through the rocks to the oil derricks and the oil derricks 
rose to the sky. Dagny stood on the bridge, looking up at the crest of the 
hill where the sun hit a spot of metal on the top of the highest rigging. 

It looked like a white torch lighted over the snow on the ridges of Wyatt 
OIL By spring, she thought, the track would meet the line growing toward it 
from Cheyenne. She let her eyes follow the green-blue rails that started from 
the derricks, came down, went across the bridge and past her. She turned her 
head to follow them through the miles of clear air, as they went on in great 
curves hung on the sides of the mountains, far to the end of the new track, 
where a locomotive crane, like an arm of naked bones and nerves, moved 
tensely against the sky. 

A tractor went past her, loaded with green-blue bolts. The sound of drills 
came as a steady shudder from far below, where men swung on metal cables, 
cutting the straight stone drop of the canyon wall to reinforce the abutments 
of the bridge. Down the track, she could see men working, their arms stiff 
with the tension of their muscles as they gripped the handles of electric tie 
tampers . 

"Muscles, Miss Taggart, " Ben Nealy, the contractor, had said to her, 
"muscles— that ' s all it takes to build anything in the world." 

No contractor equal to McNamara seemed to exist anywhere. She had taken 
the best she could find. No engineer on the Taggart staff could be trusted to 
supervise the job; all of them were skeptical about the new metal. "Frankly, 
Miss Taggart, " her chief engineer had said, "since it is an experiment that 
nobody has ever attempted before, I do not think it's fair that it should be 
my responsibility." 'It's mine," she had answered. He was a man in his 
forties, who still preserved the breezy manner of the college from which he 
had graduated. Once, Taggart Transcontinental had had a chief engineer, a 
silent, gray-haired, self educated man, who could not be matched on any 
railroad. He had resigned, five years ago. 

She glanced down over the bridge. She was standing on a slender beam of 
steel above a gorge that had cracked the mountains to a depth of fifteen 
hundred feet. Far at the bottom, she could distinguish the dim outlines of a 
dry river bed, of piled boulders, of trees contorted by centuries. She 
wondered whether boulders, tree trunks and muscles could ever bridge that 
canyon. She wondered why she found herself thinking suddenly that cave- 
dwellers had lived naked on the bottom of that canyon for ages. 

She looked up at the Wyatt oil fields. The track broke into sidings among 
the wells. She saw the small disks of switches dotted against the snow. They 
were metal switches, of the kind that were scattered in thousands, unnoticed, 
throughout the country— but these were sparkling in the sun and the sparks 
were greenish-blue. What they meant to her was hour upon hour of speaking 
quietly, evenly, patiently, trying to hit the center less target that was the 
person of Mr. Mowen, president of the Amalgamated Switch and Signal Company, 
Inc., of Connecticut. "But, Miss Taggart, my dear Miss Taggart! My company 
has served your company for generations, why, your grandfather was the first 
customer of my grandfather, so you cannot doubt our eagerness to do anything 
you ask, but— did you say switches made of Rearden Metal?" 

"Yes . " 

"But, Miss Taggart! Consider what it would mean, having to work with that 
metal. Do you know that the stuff won't melt under less than four thousand 
degrees? . . . Great? Well, maybe that's great for motor manufacturers, but 
what I'm thinking of is that it means a new type of furnace, a new process 
entirely, men to be trained, schedules upset, work rules shot, everything 



balled up and then God only knows whether it will come out right or not! . . 
. How do you know, Miss Taggart? How can you know, when it's never been done 
before? . . . 

Well, I can't say that that metal is good and I can't say that it isn't. 

. . . Well, no, I can't tell whether it's a product of genius, as you say, 
or just another fraud as a great many people are saying, Miss Taggart, a 
great many. . . . Well, no, I can't say that it does matter one way or the 
other, because who am I to take a chance on a job of this kind?" 

She had doubled the price of her order. Rearden had sent two metallurgists 
to train Mowen ' s men, to teach, to show, to explain every step of the 
process, and had paid the salaries of Mowen ' s men while they were being 
trained . 

She looked at the spikes in the rail at her feet. They meant the night 
when she had heard that Summit Casting of Illinois, the only company willing 
to make spikes of Rearden Metal, had gone bankrupt, with half of her order 
undelivered. She had flown to Chicago, that night, she had got three lawyers, 
a judge and a state legislator out of bed, she had bribed two of them and 
threatened the others, she had obtained a paper that was an emergency permit 
of a legality no one would ever be able to untangle, she had had the 
padlocked doors of the Summit Casting plant unlocked and a random, half- 
dressed crew working at the smelters before the windows had turned gray with 
daylight. The crews had remained at work, under a Taggart engineer and a 
Rearden metallurgist. The rebuilding of the Rio Norte Line was not held up. 

She listened to the sound of the drills. The work had been held up once, 
when the drilling for the bridge abutments was stepped. "I couldn't help it, 
Miss Taggart," Ben Nealy had said, offended. "You know how fast drill heads 
wear out. I had them on order, but Incorporated Tool ran into a little 
trouble, they couldn't help it either, Associated Steel was delayed in 
delivering the steel to them, so there's nothing we can do but wait. It's no 
use getting upset, Miss Taggart, I'm doing my best." 

"I've hired you to do a job, not to do your best— whatever that is." 

"That's a funny thing to say. That's an unpopular attitude, Miss Taggart, 
mighty unpopular." 

"Forget Incorporated Tool. Forget the steel. Order the doll heads made of 
Rearden Metal." 

"Not me. I've had enough trouble with the damn stuff in that rail of 
yours. I'm not going to mess up my own equipment." 

"A drill head of Rearden Metal will outlast three of steel." 
"Maybe . " 

"I said order them made." 
"Who's going to pay for it?" 
"I am." 

"Who's going to find somebody to make them?" 

She had telephoned Rearden. He had found an abandoned tool plant, long 
since out of business. Within an hour, he had purchased it from the relatives 
of its last owner. Within a day, the plant had been reopened. Within a week, 
drill heads of Rearden Metal lad been delivered to the bridge in Colorado. 

She looked at the bridge. It represented a problem badly solved, but she 
had had to accept it. The bridge, twelve hundred feet of steel across the 
black gap, was built in the days of Nat Taggart ' s son. It was long past the 
stage of safety; it had been patched with stringers of steel, then of iron, 
then of wood; it was barely worth the patching. 

She had thought of a new bridge of Rearden Metal. She had asked her chief 
engineer to submit a design and an estimate of the cost. 

The design he had submitted was the scheme of a steel bridge badly scaled 
down to the greater strength of the new metal; the cost made the project 
impossible to consider. 



"I beg your pardon, Miss Taggart, " he had said, offended. "I don't know 
what you mean when you say that I haven't made use of the metal. This design 
is an adaptation of the best bridges on record. 

What else did you expect?" 

"A new method of construction." 

"What do you mean, a new method?" 

"I mean that when men got structural steel, they did not use it to build 
steel copies of wooden bridges." She had added wearily, "Get me an estimate 
on what we'll need to make our old bridge last for another five years." 

"Yes, Miss Taggart," he had said cheerfully. "If we reinforce it with 
steel-" 

"We'll reinforce it with Rearden Metal." 
"Yes, Miss Taggart," he had said coldly. 

She looked at the snow-covered mountains. Her job had seemed hard at 
times, in New York. She had stopped for blank moments in the middle of her 
office, paralyzed by despair at the rigidity of time which she could not 
stretch any further— on a day when urgent appointments had succeeded one 
another, when she had discussed worn Diesels, rotting freight cars, failing 
signal systems, falling revenues, while thinking of the latest emergency on 
the Rio Norte construction; when she had talked, with the vision of two 
streaks of green-blue metal cutting across her mind; when she had interrupted 
the discussions, realizing suddenly why a certain news item had disturbed 
her, and seized the telephone receiver to call long-distance, to call her 
contractor, to say, "Where do you get the food from, for your men? 

. . . I thought so. Well, Barton and Jones of Denver went bankrupt 
yesterday. Better find another supplier at once, if you don't want to have a 
famine on your hands." She had been building the line from her desk in New 
York. It had seemed hard. But now she was looking at the track. It was 
growing. It would be done on time. 

She heard sharp, hurried footsteps, and turned. A man was coming up the 
track. He was tall and young, his head of black hair was hatless in the cold 
wind, he wore a workman's leather jacket, but he did not look like a workman, 
there was too imperious an assurance in the way he walked. She could not 
recognize the face until he came closer. It was Ellis Wyatt. She had not seen 
him since that one interview in her office. 

He approached, stopped, looked at her and smiled. 

"Hello, Dagny, " he said. 

In a single shock of emotion, she knew everything the two words were 
intended to tell her. It was forgiveness, understanding, acknowledgment. It 
was a salute. 

She laughed, like a child, in happiness that things should be as right as 
that. 

"Hello," she said, extending her hand. 

His hand held hers an instant longer than a greeting required. It was 
their signature under a score settled and understood. 

"Tell Nealy to put up new snow fences for a mile and a half on Granada 
Pass," he said. "The old ones are rotted. They won't stand through another 
storm. Send him a rotary plow. What he's got is a piece of junk that wouldn't 
sweep a back yard. The big snows are coming any day now." 

She considered him for a moment. "How often have you been doing this?" she 
asked, "What?" 

"Coming to watch the work." 

"Every now and then. When I have the time. Why?" 

"Were you here the night when they had the rock slide?" 

"Yes . " 



"I was surprised how quickly and well they cleared the track, when I got 
the reports about it. It made me think that Nealy was a better man than I had 
thought" 

"He isn't." 

"Was it you who organized the system of moving his day's supplies down to 
the line?" 

"Sure. His men used to spend half their time hunting for things. 

Tell him to watch his water tanks. They'll freeze on him one of these 
nights. See if you can get him a new ditcher. I don't like the looks of the 
one he's got. Check on his wiring system." 

She looked at him for a moment. "Thanks, Ellis," she said. 

He smiled and walked on. She watched him as he walked across the bridge, 
as he started up the long rise toward his derricks. 

"He thinks he owns the place, doesn't he?" 

She turned, startled. Ben Nealy had approached her; his thumb was pointing 
at Ellis Wyatt. 
"What place?" 

"The railroad, Miss Taggart. Your railroad. Or the whole world maybe. 
That's what he thinks." 

Ben Nealy was a bulky man with a soft, sullen face. His eyes were stubborn 
and blank. In die bluish light of the snow, his skin had the tinge of butter. 

"What does he keep hanging around here for?" he said. "As if nobody knew 
their business but him. The snooty show-off. Who does he think he is?" 

"God damn you," said Dagny evenly, not raising her voice. 

Nealy could never know what had made her say it. But some part of him, in 
some way of his own, knew it: the shocking thing to her was that he was not 
shocked. He said nothing. 

"Let's go to your quarters," she said wearily, pointing to an old railway 
coach on a spur in the distance. "Have somebody there to take notes." 

"Now about those crossties, Miss Taggart," he said hastily as they 
started. "Mr. Coleman of your office okayed them. He didn't say anything 
about too much bark. I don't see why you think they're—" 

"I said you're going to replace them." 

When she came out of the coach, exhausted by two hours of effort to be 
patient, to instruct, to explain— she saw an automobile parked on the torn 
dirt road below, a black two-seater, sparkling and new. A new car was an 
astonishing sight anywhere; one did not see them often. 

She glanced around and gasped at the sight of the tall figure standing at 
the foot of the bridge. It was Hank Rearden; she had not expected to find him 
in Colorado. He seemed absorbed in calculations, pencil and notebook in hand. 
His clothes attracted attention, like his car and for the same reason; he 
wore a simple trenchcoat and a hat with a slanting brim, but they were of 
such good quality, so flagrantly expensive that they appeared ostentatious 
among the seedy garments of the crowds everywhere, the more ostentatious 
because worn so naturally. 

She noticed suddenly that she was running toward him; she had lost all 
trace of exhaustion. Then she remembered that she had not seen him since the 
party. She stopped. 

He saw her, he waved to her in a gesture of pleased, astonished greeting, 
and he walked forward to meet her. He was smiling. 

"Hello," he said. "Your first trip to the job?" 

"My fifth, in three months." 

"I didn't know you were here. Nobody told me." 
"I thought you'd break down some day." 
"Break down?" 

"Enough to come and see this. There's your Metal. How do you like it?" 



He glanced around. "If you ever decide to quit the railroad business, let 
me know . " 

"You'd give me a job?" 
"Any time." 

She looked at him for a moment. "You're only half-kidding, Hank. 
I think you'd like it— having me ask you for a job. Having me for an 
employee instead of a customer. Giving me orders to obey." 
"Yes. I would." 

She said, her face hard, "Don't quit the steel business, I won't promise 
you a job on the railroad." 
He laughed. "Don't try it." 
"What?" 

"To win any battle when I set the terms." 

She did not answer. She was struck by what the words made her feel; it was 
not an emotion, but a physical sensation of pleasure, which she could not 
name or understand. 

"incidentally," he said, "this is not my first trip. I was here 
yesterday . " 

"You were? Why?" 

"Oh, I came to Colorado on some business of my own, so I thought I'd take 
a look at this . " 

"What are you after?" 

"Why do you assume that I'm after anything?" 

"You wouldn't waste time coming here just to look. Not twice." 
He laughed. "True." He pointed at the bridge. "I'm after that." 
"What about it?" 

"It's ready for the scrap heap." 

"Do you suppose that I don't know it?" 

"I saw the specifications of your order for Rearden Metal members for that 
bridge. You're wasting your money. The difference between what you're 
planning to spend on a makeshift that will last a couple of years, and the 
cost of a new Rearden Metal bridge, is comparatively so little that I don't 
see why you want to bother preserving this museum piece." 

"I've thought of a new Rearden Metal bridge, I've had my engineers give me 
an estimate." 

"What did they tell you?" 

"Two million dollars." 

"Good God!" 

"What would you say?" 

"Eight hundred thousand." 

She looked at him. She knew that he never spoke idly. She asked, trying to 
sound calm, "How?" 
"Like this." 

He showed her his notebook. She saw the disjoined notations he had made, a 
great many figures, a few rough sketches. She understood his scheme before he 
had finished explaining it. She did not notice that they had sat down, that 
they were sitting on a pile of frozen lumber, that her legs were pressed to 
the rough planks and she could feel the cold through her thin stockings. They 
were bent together over a few scraps of paper which could make it possible 
for thousands of tons of freight to cross a cut of empty space. His voice 
sounded sharp and clear, while he explained thrusts, pulls, loads, wind 
pressures. The bridge was to be a single twelve-hundred-foot truss span. He 
had devised a new type of truss. It had never been made before end could not 
be made except with members that had the strength and the lightness of 
Rearden Metal. 

"Hank," she asked, "did you invent this in two days?" 



"Hell, no. I 'invented' it long before I had Rearden Metal. I figured it 
out while making steel for bridges. I wanted a metal with which one would be 
able to do this, among other things. I came here just to see your particular 
problem for myself." 

He chuckled, when he saw the slow movement of her hand across her eyes and 
the line of bitterness in the set of her mouth, as if she were trying to wipe 
out the things against which she had fought such an exhausting, cheerless 
battle . 

"This is only a rough scheme, " he said, "but I believe you see what can be 
done?" 

"I can't tell you all that I see, Hank." 
"Don't bother. I know it." 

"You're saving Taggart Transcontinental for the second time." 
"You used to be a better psychologist than that." 
"What do you mean?" 

"Why should I give a damn about saving Taggart Transcontinental? 
Don't you know that I want to have a bridge of Rearden Metal to show the 
country? " 

"Yes, Hank. I know it" 

"There are too many people yelping that rails of Rearden Metal are unsafe. 
So I thought I'd give them something real to yelp about. Let them see a 
bridge of Rearden Metal." 

She looked at him and laughed aloud in simple delight. 

"Now what's that?" he asked. 

"Hank, I don't know anyone, not anyone in the world, who'd think of such 
an answer to people, in such circumstances— except you." 

"What about you? Would you want to make the answer with me and face the 
same screaming?" 

"You knew I would." 

"Yes. I knew it." 

He glanced at her, his eyes narrowed; he did not laugh as she had, but the 
glance was an equivalent. 

She remembered suddenly their last meeting, at the party. The memory 
seemed incredible. Their ease with each other— the strange, light-headed 
feeling, which included the knowledge that it was the only sense of ease 
either of them found anywhere— made the thought of hostility impossible. Yet 
she knew that the party had taken place; he acted as if it had not. 

They walked to the edge of the canyon. Together, they looked at the dark 
drop, at the rise of rock beyond it, at the sun high on the derricks of Wyatt 
Oil. She stood, her feet apart on the frozen stones, braced firmly against 
the wind. She could feel, without touching it, the line of his chest behind 
her shoulder. The wind beat her coat against his legs. 

"Hank, do you think we can build it in time? There are only six months 
left. " 

"Sure. It will take less time and labor than any other type of bridge. 

Let me have my engineers work out the basic scheme and submit it to you. 
No obligation on your part. Just take a look at it and see for yourself 
whether you'll be able to afford it. You will. Then you can let your college 
boys work out the details." 

"What about the Metal?" 

"I'll get the Metal rolled if I have to throw every other order out of the 
mills . " 

"You'll get it rolled on so short a notice?" 
"Have I ever held you up on an order?" 

"No. But the way things are going nowadays, you might not be able to help 
it. " 

"Who do you think you're talking to— Orren Boyle?" 



She laughed. "All right. Let me have the drawings as soon as possible. 
I'll take a look and let you know within forty-eight hours. As to my college 
boys, they—" She stopped, frowning. "Hank, why is it so hard to find good men 
for any job nowadays?" 

"I don't know ..." 

He looked at the lines of the mountains cut across the sky. A thin jet of 
smoke was rising from a distant valley. 

"Have you seen the new towns of Colorado and the factories?" he asked. 
"Yes . " 

"It's great, isn't it?— to see the kind of men they've gathered here from 
every corner of the country. All of them young, all of them starting on a 
shoestring and moving mountains." 

"What mountain have you decided to move?" 

"Why?" 

"What are you doing in Colorado?" 

He smiled. "Looking at a mining property." 

"What sort?" 

"Copper . " 

"Good God, don't you have enough to do?" 

"I know it's a complicated job. But the supply of copper is becoming 
completely unreliable. There doesn't seem to be a single first-rate company 
left in the business in this country— and I don't want to deal with d'Anconia 
Copper. I don't trust that playboy." 

"I don't blame you," she said, looking away. 

"So if there's no competent person left to do it, I'll have to mine my own 
copper, as I mine my own iron ore. I can't take any chances on being held up 
by all those failures and shortages. I need a great deal of copper for 
Rearden Metal." 

"Have you bought the mine?" 

"Not yet. There are a few problems to solve. Getting the men, the 
equipment, the transportation." 

"Oh . . . !" She chuckled. "Going to speak to me about building a branch 
line?" 

"Might. There's no limit to what's possible in this state. Do you know 
that they have every kind of natural resource here, waiting, untouched? And 
the way their factories are growing! I feel ten years younger when I come 
here . " 

"I don't." She was looking east, past the mountains. "I think of the 
contrast, all over the rest of the Taggart system. There's less to carry, 
less tonnage produced each year. It's as if . . . Hank, what's wrong with the 
country? " 

"I don't know." 

"I keep thinking of what they told us in school about the sun losing 
energy, growing colder each year. I remember wondering, then, what it would 
be like in the last days of the world. I think it would be . . . 

like this. Growing colder and things stopping." 

"I never believed that story. I thought by the time the sun was exhausted, 
men would find a substitute." 

"You did? Funny. I thought that, too." 

He pointed at the column of smoke. "There's your new sunrise. It's going 
to feed the rest." 

"If it's not stopped." 

"Do you think it can be stopped?" 

She looked at the rail under her feet. "No," she said. 

He smiled. He looked down at the rail, then let his eyes move along the 
track, up the sides of the mountains, to the distant crane. She saw two 



things, as if, for a moment, the two stood alone in her field of vision: the 
lines of his profile and the green-blue cord coiling through space. 
"We've done it, haven't we?" he said. 

In payment for every effort, for every sleepless night, for every silent 
thrust against despair, this moment was all she wanted. "Yes. We have." 

She looked away, noticed an old crane on a siding, and thought that its 
cables were worn and would need replacing: This was the great clarity of 
being beyond emotion, after the reward of having felt everything one could 
feel. Their achievement, she thought, and one moment of acknowledging it, of 
possessing it together— what greater intimacy could one share? Now she was 
free for the simplest, most commonplace concerns of the moment, because 
nothing could be meaningless within her sight. 

She wondered what made her certain that he felt as she did. He turned 
abruptly and started toward his car. She followed. They did not look at each 
other . 

"I'm due to leave for the East in an hour," he said. 
She pointed at the car. "Where did you get that?" 

"Here. It's a Hammond. Hammond of Colorado— they ' re the only people who ' re 
still making a good car. I just bought it, on this trip." 
"Wonderful job." 
"Yes, isn't it?" 

"Going to drive it back to New York?" 

"No. Tm having it shipped. I flew my plane down here." 

"Oh, you did? I drove down from Cheyenne— I had to see the line —but I'm 
anxious to get home as fast as possible. Would you take me along? Can I fly 
back with you?" 

He did not answer at once. She noticed the empty moment of a pause. "I'm 
sorry, " he said; she wondered whether she imagined the note of abruptness in 
his voice. "I'm not flying back to New York. I'm going to Minnesota." 

"Oh well, then I'll try to get on an air liner, if I can find one today," 

She watched his car vanish down the winding road. She drove to the airport 
an hour later. The place was a small field at the bottom of a break in the 
desolate chain of mountains. There were patches of snow on the hard, pitted 
earth. The pole of a beacon stood at one side, trailing wires to the ground; 
the other poles had been knocked down by a storm. 

A lonely attendant came to meet her. "No, Miss Taggart, " he said 
regretfully, "no planes till day after tomorrow. There's only one 
transcontinental liner every two days, you know, and the one that was due 
today has been grounded, down in Arizona. Engine trouble, as usual." He 
added, "It's a pity you didn't get here a bit sooner. Mr. 

Rearden took off for New York, in his private plane, just a little while 
ago . " 

"He wasn't flying to New York, was be?" 
"Why, yes. He said so." 
"Are you sure?" 

"He said he had an appointment there tonight." 

She looked at the sky to the east, blankly, without moving. She had no 
clue to any reason, nothing to give her a foothold, nothing with which to 
weigh this or fight it or understand. 

"Damn these streets!" said James Taggart. "We're going to be late." 

Dagny glanced ahead, past the back of the chauffeur. Through the circle 
made by a windshield wiper on the sleet-streaked glass, she saw black, worn, 
glistening car tops strung in a motionless line. Far ahead, the smear of a 
red lantern, low over the ground, marked a street excavation. 

"There's something wrong on every other street," said Taggart irritably. 
"Why doesn't somebody fix them?" 

She leaned back against the seat, tightening the collar of her wrap. 



She felt exhausted at the end of a day she had started at her desk, in her 
office, at seven A.M.; a day she had broken off, uncompleted, to rush home 
and dress, because she had promised Jim to speak at the dinner of the New 
York Business Council "They want us to give them a talk about Rearden Metal," 
he had said. "You can do it so much better than I. It's very important that 
we present a good case. There's such a controversy about Rearden Metal." 

Sitting beside him in his car, she regretted that she had agreed. She 
looked at the streets of New York and thought of the race between metal and 
time, between the rails of the Rio Norte Line and the passing days. She felt 
as if her nerves were being pulled tight by the stillness of the car, by the 
guilt of wasting an evening when she could not afford to waste an hour. 

"With all those attacks on Rearden that one hears everywhere, " 

said Taggart, "he might need a few friends." 

She glanced at him incredulously. "You mean you want to stand by him?" 
He did not answer at once; he asked, his voice bleak, "That report of the 
special committee of the National Council of Metal Industries— 
what do you think of it?" 
"You know what I think of it." 

"They said Rearden Metal is a threat to public safety. They said its 
chemical composition is unsound, it's brittle, it's decomposing molecularly, 
and it will crack suddenly, without warning . . ."He stopped, as if begging 
for an answer. She did not answer. He asked anxiously, "You haven't changed 
your mind about it, have you?" 

"About what?" 

"About that metal . " 

"No, Jim, I have not changed my mind." 

"They're experts, though . . . the men on that committee. . . . 

Top experts . . . Chief metallurgists for the biggest corporations, with a 
string of degrees from universities all over the country . . ."He said it 
unhappily, as if he were begging her to make him doubt these men and their 
verdict . 

She watched him, puzzled; this was not like him. 

The car jerked forward. It moved slowly through a gap in a plank barrier, 
past the hole of a broken water main. She saw the new pipe stacked by the 
excavation; the pipe bore a trademark: Stockton Foundry, Colorado. She looked 
away; she wished she were not reminded of Colorado. 

"I can't understand it . . ." said Taggart miserably. "The top experts of 
the National Council of Metal Industries . . ." 

"Who's the president of the National Council of Metal Industries, Jim? 
Orren Boyle, isn't it?" 

Taggart did not turn to her, but his jaw snapped open. "If that fat slob 
thinks he can—" he started, but stopped and did not finish. 

She looked up at a street lamp on the corner. It was a globe of glass 
filled with light. It hung, secure from storm, lighting boarded windows and 
cracked sidewalks, as their only guardian. At the end of the street, across 
the river, against the glow of a factory, she saw the thin tracing of a power 
station. A truck went by, hiding her view. It was the kind of truck that fed 
the power station— a tank truck, its bright new paint impervious to sleet, 
green with white letters: Wyatt Oil, Colorado. 

"Dagny, have you heard about that discussion at the structural steel 
workers' union meeting in Detroit?" 

"No. What discussion?" 

"It was in all the newspapers. They debated whether their members should 
or should not be permitted to work with Rearden Metal. 

They didn't reach a decision, but that was enough for the contractor who 
was going to take a chance on Rearden Metal. He cancelled his order, but 
fast! . . . What if . . . what if everybody decides against it?" 



"Let them." 

A dot of light was rising in a straight line to the top of an invisible 
tower. It was the elevator of a great hotel. The car went past the building's 
alley. Men were moving a heavy, crated piece of equipment from a truck into 
the basement. She saw the name on the crate: Nielsen Motors, Colorado. 

"I don't like that resolution passed by the convention of the grade school 
teachers of New Mexico," said Taggart. 

"What resolution?" 

"They resolved that it was their opinion that children should not be 
permitted to ride on the new Rio Norte Line of Taggart Transcontinental when 
it's completed, because it is unsafe. . . . They said it specifically, the 
new line of Taggart Transcontinental. It was in all the newspapers. It's 
terrible publicity for us. . . . Dagny, what do you think we should do to 
answer them?" 

"Run the first train on the new Rio Norte Line." 

He remained silent for a long time. He looked strangely dejected. 

She could not understand it: he did not gloat, he did not use the opinions 
of his favorite authorities against her, he seemed to be pleading for 
reassurance . 

A car flashed past them; she had a moment's glimpse of power— a smooth, 
confident motion and a shining body. She knew the make of the car: Hammond, 
Colorado . 

"Dagny, are we . . . are we going to have that line built ... on time?" 
It was strange to hear a note of plain emotion in his voice, the 
uncomplicated sound of animal fear. 

"God help this city, if we don't!" she answered. 

The car turned a corner. Above the black roofs of the city, she saw the 
page of the calendar, hit by the white glare of a spotlight. It said: January 
29. 

"Dan Conway is a bastard!" 

The words broke out suddenly, as if he could not hold them any longer. 
She looked at him, bewildered. "Why?" 

"He refused to sell us the Colorado track of the Phoenix-Durango . " 
"You didn't—" She had to stop. She started again, keeping her voice flat 
in order not to scream. "You haven't approached him about it?" 
"Of course I have!" 

"You didn't expect him ... to sell it ... to you?" 

"Why not?" His hysterically belligerent manner was back, "I offered him 
more than anybody else did. We wouldn't have had the expense of tearing it up 
and carting it off, we could have used it as is. And it would have been 
wonderful publicity for us— that we're giving up the Rearden Metal track in 
deference to public opinion. It would have been worth every penny of it in 
good will! But the son of a bitch refused. He's actually declared that not a 
foot of rail would be sold to Taggart Transcontinental. He's selling it 
piecemeal to any stray comer, to one-horse railroads in Arkansas or North 
Dakota, selling it at a loss, way under what I offered him, the bastard! 
Doesn't even want to take a profit! And you should see those vultures 
flocking to him! They know they'd never have a chance to get rail anywhere 
else!" 

She sat, her head bowed. She could not bear to look at him. 

"I think it's contrary to the intent of the Anti-dog-cat-dog Rule," he 
said angrily. "I think it was the intent and purpose of the National Alliance 
of Railroads to protect the essential systems, not the jerkwaters of North 
Dakota. But I can't get the Alliance to vote on it now, because they're all 
down there, outbidding one another for that rail!" 

She said slowly, as if she wished it were possible to wear gloves to 
handle the words, "I see why you want me to defend Rearden Metal." 



"I don't know what you're—" 
"Shut up, Jim, " she said quietly. 

He remained silent for a moment. Then he drew his head back and drawled 
defiantly, "You'd better do a good job of defending Rearden Metal, because 
Bertram Scudder can get pretty sarcastic." 

"Bertram Scudder?" 

"He's going to be one of the speakers tonight." 

"One of the . . . You didn't tell me there were to be other speakers." 
"Well . . . I . . . What difference does that make? You're not afraid of 
him, are you?" 

"The New York Business Council . . . and you invite Bertram Scudder?" 

"Why not? Don't you think it's smart? He doesn't have any hard feelings 
toward businessmen, not really. He's accepted the invitation. 

We want to be broad-minded and hear all sides and maybe win him over. . . 
. Well, what are you staring at? You'll be able to beat him, won't you?" 

". . .to beat him?" 

"On the air. It's going to be a radio broadcast. You're going to debate 
with him the question: 'Is Rearden Metal a lethal product of greed?' " 

She leaned forward. She pulled open the glass partition of the front seat, 
ordering, "Stop the car!" 

She did not hear what Taggart was saying. She noticed dimly that his voice 
rose to screams: "They're waiting! . . . Five hundred people at the dinner, 
and a national hook-up! . . . You can't do this to me!" 

He seized her arm, screaming, "But why?" 

"You goddamn fool, do you think I consider their question debatable?" 
The car stopped, she leaped out and ran. 

The first tiling she noticed after a while, was her slippers. She was 
walking slowly, normally, and it was strange to feel iced stone under the 
thin soles of black satin sandals. She pushed her hair back, off her 
forehead, and felt drops of sleet melting on her palm. 

She was quiet now; the blinding anger was gone; she felt nothing but a 
gray weariness. Her head ached a little, she realized that she was hungry and 
remembered that she was to have had dinner at the Business Council. She 
walked on. She did not want to eat. She thought she would get a cup of coffee 
somewhere, then take a cab home. 

She glanced around her. There were no cabs in sight. She did not know the 
neighborhood. It did not seem to be a good one. She saw an empty stretch of 
space across the street, an abandoned park encircled by a jagged line that 
began as distant skyscrapers and came down to factory chimneys; she saw a few 
lights in the windows of dilapidated houses, a few small, grimy shops closed 
for the night, and the fog of the East River two blocks away. 

She started back toward the center of the city. The black shape of a ruin 
rose before her. It had been an office building, long ago; she saw the sky 
through the naked steel skeleton and the angular remnants of the bricks that 
had crumbled. In the shadow of the ruin, like a blade of grass fighting to 
live at the roots of a dead giant, there stood a small diner. Its windows 
were a bright band of glass and light. She went in. 

There was a clean counter inside, with a shining strip of chromium at the 
edges. There was a bright metal boiler and the odor of coffee. A few 
derelicts sat at the counter, a husky, elderly man stood behind it, the 
sleeves of his clean white shirt rolled at the elbows. The warm air made her 
realize, in simple gratitude, that she had been cold. She pulled her black 
velvet cape tight about her and sat down at the counter. 

"A cup of coffee, please," she said. 

The men looked at her without curiosity. They did not seem astonished to 
see a woman in evening clothes enter a slum diner; nothing astonished anyone, 



these days. The owner turned impassively to fill her order; there was, in his 
stolid indifference, the kind of mercifulness that asks no questions. 

She could not tell whether the four at the counter were beggars or Working 
men; neither clothes nor manner showed the difference, these days. The owner 
placed a mug of coffee before her. She closed both hands about it, finding 
enjoyment in its warmth. 

She glanced around her and thought, in habitual professional calculation, 
how wonderful it was that one could buy so much for a dime. 

Her eyes moved from the stainless steel cylinder of the coffee boiler to 
the cast-iron griddle, to the glass shelves, to the enameled sink, to the 
chromium blades of a mixer. The owner was making toast. She found pleasure in 
watching the ingenuity of an open belt that moved slowly, carrying slices of 
bread past glowing electric coils. Then she saw the name stamped on the 
toaster: Marsh, Colorado. 

Her head fell down on her arm on the counter. 

"It's no use, lady," said the old bum beside her. 

She had to raise her head. She had to smile in amusement, at him and at 
herself . 

"It isn't?" she asked. 

"No. Forget it. You're only fooling yourself." 
"About what?" 

"About anything being worth a damn. It's dust, lady, all of it, dust and 
blood. Don't believe the dreams they pump you full of, and you won't get 
hurt. " 

"What dreams?" 

"The stories they tell you when you're young— about the human spirit. There 
isn't any human spirit. Man is just a low-grade animal, without intellect, 
without soul, without virtues or moral values. An animal with only two 
capacities: to eat and to reproduce." 

His gaunt face, with staring eyes and shrunken features that had been 
delicate, still retained a trace of distinction. He looked like the hulk of 
an evangelist or a professor of esthetics who had spent years in 
contemplation in obscure museums. She wondered what had destroyed him, what 
error on the way could bring a man to this. 

"You go through life looking for beauty, for greatness, for some sublime 
achievement," he said. "And what do you find? A lot of trick machinery for 
making upholstered cars or inner-spring mattresses." 

"What's wrong with inner-spring mattresses?" said a man who looked like a 
truck driver. "Don't mind him, lady. He likes to hear himself talk. He don't 
mean no harm. " 

"Man's only talent is an ignoble cunning for satisfying the needs of his 
body," said the old bum. "No intelligence is required for that. 

Don't believe the stories about man's mind, his spirit, his ideals, his 
sense of unlimited ambition." 

"I don't," said a young boy who sat at the end of the counter. He wore a 
coat ripped across one shoulder; his square-shaped mouth seemed formed by the 
bitterness of a lifetime. 

"Spirit?" said the old bum. "There's no spirit involved in manufacturing 
or in sex. Yet these are man's only concerns. Matter— that ' s all men know or 
care about. As witness our great industries— the only accomplishment of our 
alleged civilization— built by vulgar materialists with the aims, the 
interests and the moral sense of hogs. It doesn't take any morality to turn 
out a ten-ton truck on an assembly line." 

"What is morality?" she asked. 

"Judgment to distinguish right and wrong, vision to see the truth, courage 
to act upon it, dedication to that which is good, integrity to stand by the 
good at any price. But where does one find it?" 



The young boy made a sound that was half-chuckle, half-sneer: "Who is John 
Gait?" 

She drank the coffee, concerned with nothing but the pleasure of feeling 
as if the hot liquid were reviving the arteries of her body. 

"I can tell you," said a small, shriveled tramp who wore a cap pulled low 
over his eyes. "I know." 

Nobody heard him or paid any attention. The young boy was watching Dagny 
with a kind of fierce, purposeless intensity. 

"You're not afraid," he said to her suddenly, without explanation, a fiat 
statement in a brusque, lifeless voice that had a note of wonder. 

She looked at him. "No," she said, "I'm not." 

"I know who is John Gait," said the tramp. "It's a secret, but I know it." 
"Who?" she asked without interest. 

"An explorer," said the tramp. "The greatest explorer that ever lived. The 
man who found the fountain of youth." 

"Give me another cup. Black," said the old bum, pushing his cup across the 
counter . 

"John Gait spent years looking for it. He crossed oceans, and he crossed 
deserts, and he went down into forgotten mines, miles under the earth. But he 
found it on the top of a mountain. It took him ten years to climb that 
mountain. It broke every bone in his body, it tore the skin off his hands, it 
made him lose his home, his name, his love. 

But he climbed it. He found the fountain of youth, which he wanted to 
bring down to men. Only he never came back." 

"Why didn't he?" she asked. 

"Because he found that it couldn't be brought down." 

The man who sat in front of Rearden's desk had vague features and a manner 
devoid of all emphasis, so that one could form no specific image of his face 
nor detect the driving motive of his person. His only mark of distinction 
seemed to be a bulbous nose, a bit too large for the rest of him; his manner 
was meek, but it conveyed a preposterous hint, the hint of a threat 
deliberately kept furtive, yet intended to be recognized. Rearden could not 
understand the purpose of his visit. He was Dr. Potter, who held some 
undefined position with the State Science Institute. 

"What do you want?" Rearden asked for the third time. 

"It is the social aspect that I am asking you to consider, Mr. 

Rearden," the man said softly, "I urge you to take note of the age we're 
living in. Our economy is not ready for it." 

"For what?" 

"Our economy is in a state of extremely precarious equilibrium. We all 
have to pool our efforts to save it from collapse." 
"Well, what is it you want me to do?" 

"These are the considerations which I was asked to call to your attention. 
I am from the State Science Institute, Mr. Rearden." 

"You've said so before. But what did you wish to see me about?" 

"The State Science Institute does not hold a favorable opinion of Rearden 
Metal . " 

"You've said that, too." 

"Isn't that a factor which you must take into consideration?" 
"No . " 

The light was growing dim in the broad windows of the office. The days 
were short. Rearden saw the irregular shadow of the nose on the man's cheek, 
and the pale eyes watching him; the glance was vague, but its direction 
purposeful . 

"The State Science Institute represents the best brains of the country, 
Mr. Rearden." 

"So I'm told. " 



"Surely you do not want to pit your own judgment against theirs?" 
"I do." 

The man looked at Rearden as if pleading for help, as if Rearden had 
broken an unwritten code which demanded that he should have understood long 
ago. Rearden offered no help. 

"Is this all you wanted to know?" he asked. 

"It's only a question of time, Mr. Rearden," the man said placatingly. 
"Just a temporary delay. Just to give our economy a chance to get stabilized. 
If you'd only wait for a couple of years—" 

Rearden chuckled, gaily, contemptuously. "So that's what you're after? 
Want me to take Rearden Metal off the market? Why?" 

"Only for a few years, Mr. Rearden. Only until—" 

"Look," said Rearden. "Now I'll ask you a question: did your scientists 
decide that Rearden Metal is not what I claim it is?" 
"We have not committed ourselves as to that." 
"Did they decide it's no good?" 

"It is the social impact of a product that must be considered. We are 
thinking in terms of the country as a whole, we are concerned with the public 
welfare and the terrible crisis of the present moment, which—" 

"Is Rearden Metal good or not?" 

"If we view the picture from the angle of the alarming growth of 
unemployment, which at present—" 
"Is Rearden Metal good?" 

"At a time of desperate steel shortage, we cannot afford to permit the 
expansion of a steel company which produces too much, because it might throw 
out of business the companies which produce too little, thus creating an 
unbalanced economy which—" 

"Are you going to answer my question?" 

The man shrugged. "Questions of value are relative. If Rearden Metal is 
not good, it's a physical danger to the public. If it is good- 
it's a social danger." 

"If you have anything to say to me about the physical danger of Rearden 
Metal, say it. Drop the rest of it. Fast. I don't speak that language." 
"But surely questions of social welfare—" 
"Drop it." 

The man looked bewildered and lost, as if the ground had been cut from 
under his feet. In a moment, he asked helplessly, "But what, then, is your 
chief concern?" 

"The market." 

"How do you mean?" 

"There's a market for Rearden Metal and I intend to take full advantage of 
it. " 

"Isn't the market somewhat hypothetical? The public response to your metal 
has not been encouraging. Except for the order from Taggart Transcontinental, 
you haven't obtained any major—" 

"Well, then, if you think the public won't go for it, what are you 
worrying about?" 

"If the public doesn't go for it, you will take a heavy loss, Mr. 
Rearden . " 

"That's my worry, not yours." 

"Whereas, if you adopt a more co-operative attitude and agree to wait for 
a few years—" 

"Why should I wait?" 

"But I believe I have made it clear that the State Science Institute does 
not approve of the appearance of Rearden Metal on the metallurgical scene at 
the present time." 

"Why should I give a damn about that?" 



The man sighed. "You are a very difficult man, Mr. Rearden." 

The sky of the late afternoon was growing heavy, as if thickening against 
the glass of the windowpanes. The outlines of the man's figure seemed to 
dissolve into a blob among the sharp, straight planes of the furniture. 

"I gave you this appointment, " said Rearden, "because you told me that you 
wished to discuss something of extreme importance. If this is all you had to 
say, you will please excuse me now. I am very busy." 

The man settled back in his chair. "I believe you have spent ten years of 
research on Rearden Metal," he said. "How much has it cost you?" 

Rearden glanced up: he could not understand the drift of the question, yet 
there was an undisguised purposef ulness in the man's voice; the voice had 
hardened . 

"One and a half million dollars," said Rearden. 
"How much will you take for it?" 

Rearden had to let a moment pass. He could not believe it. "For what?" he 
asked, his voice low. 

"For all rights to Rearden Metal." 

"I think you had better get out of here,"' said Rearden. 
"There is no call for such an attitude. You are a businessman. I am 
offering you a business proposition. You may name your own price." 
"The rights to Rearden Metal are not for sale." 

"I am in a position to speak of large sums of money. Government money." 

Rearden sat without moving, the muscles of his cheeks pulled tight; but 
his glance was indifferent, focused only by the faint pull of morbid 
curiosity . 

"You are a businessman, Mr. Rearden. This is a proposition which you 
cannot afford to ignore. On the one hand, you are gambling against great 
odds, you are bucking an unfavorable public opinion, you run a good chance of 
losing every penny you put into Rearden Metal. On the other hand, we can 
relieve you of the risk and the responsibility, at an impressive profit, an 
immediate profit, much larger than you could hope to realize from the sale of 
the metal for the next twenty years." 

"The State Science Institute is a scientific establishment, not a 
commercial one," said Rearden. "What is it that they're so afraid of?" 

"You are using ugly, unnecessary words, Mr. Rearden. I am endeavoring to 
suggest that we keep the discussion on a friendly plane. The matter is 
serious . " 

"I am beginning to see that." 

"We are offering you a blank check on what is, as you realize, an 
unlimited account. What else can you want? Name your price." 

"The sale of the rights to Rearden Metal is not open to discussion. 

If you have anything else to say, please say it and leave." 

The man leaned back, looked at Rearden incredulously and asked, "What are 
you after?" 

"I? What do you mean?" 

"You're in business to make money, aren't you?" 
"I am." 

"You want to make as big a profit as possible, don't you?" 
"I do." 

"Then why do you want to struggle for years, squeezing out your gains in 
the form of pennies per ton— rather than accept a fortune for Rearden Metal? 
Why?" 

"Because it's mine. Do you understand the word?" 

The man sighed and rose to his feet. "I hope you will not have cause to 
regret your decision, Mr. Rearden," he said; the tone of his voice was 
suggesting the opposite. 

"Good day," said Rearden. 



"I think I must tell you that the State Science Institute may issue an 
official statement condemning Rearden Metal." 
'That is their privilege." 

"Such a statement would make things more difficult for you." 
"Undoubtedly. " 

"As to further consequences . . ." The man shrugged. "This is not the day 
for people who refuse to co-operate. In this age, one needs friends. You are 
not a popular man, Mr. Rearden." 

"What are you trying to say?" 

"Surely, you understand." 

"I don't." 

"Society is a complex structure. There are so many different issues 
awaiting decision, hanging by a thin thread. We can never tell when one such 
issue may he decided and what may be the decisive factor in a delicate 
balance. Do I make myself clear?" 

"No. " 

The red flame of poured steel shot through the twilight. An orange glow, 
the color of deep gold, hit the wall behind Rearden 's desk. 

The glow moved gently across his forehead. His face had an unmoving 
serenity . 

"The State Science Institute is a government organization, Mr. 

Rearden. There are certain bills pending in the Legislature, which may be 
passed at any moment. Businessmen are peculiarly vulnerable these days. I am 
sure you understand me." 

Rearden rose to his feet. He was smiling. He looked as if all tension had 
left him. 

"No, Dr. Potter," he said, "I don't understand. If I did, I'd have to kill 
you . " 

The man walked to the door, then stopped and looked at Rearden in a way 
which, for once, was simple human curiosity. Rearden stood motionless against 
the moving glow on the wall; he stood casually, his hands in his pockets. 

"Would you tell me," the man asked, "just between us, it's only my 
personal curiosity— why are you doing this?" 

Rearden answered quietly, "I'll tell you. You won't understand. You see, 
it's because Rearden Metal is good." 

Dagny could not understand Mr. Mowen ' s motive. The Amalgamated Switch and 
Signal Company had suddenly given notice that they would not complete her 
order. Nothing had happened, she could find no cause for it and they would 
give no explanation. 

She had hurried to Connecticut, to see Mr. Mowen in person, but the sole 
result of the interview was a heavier, grayer weight of bewilderment in her 
mind. Mr. Mowen stated that he would not continue to make switches of Rearden 
Metal. For sole explanation, he said, avoiding her eyes, "Too many people 
don't like it." 

"What? Rearden Metal or your making the switches?" 

"Both, I guess . . . People don't like it ... I don't want any trouble." 
"What kind of trouble?" 
"Any kind." 

"Have you heard a single thing against Rearden Metal that's true?" 

"Aw, who knows what's true? . . . That resolution of the National Council 
of Metal Industries said—" 

"Look, you've worked with metals all your life. For the last four months, 
you've worked with Rearden Metal. Don't you know that it's the greatest thing 
you've ever handled?" He did not answer. "Don't you know it?" He looked away. 
"Don't you know what's true?" 

"Hell, Miss Taggart, I'm in business, I'm only a little guy. I just want 
to make money." 



"How do you think one makes it?" 

But she knew that it was useless. Looking at Mr. Mowen ' s face, at the eyes 
which she could not catch, she felt as she had felt once on a lonely section 
of track, when a storm blew down the telephone wires: that communications 
were cut and that words had become sounds which transmitted nothing. 

It was useless to argue, she thought, and to wonder about people who would 
neither refute an argument nor accept it. Sitting restlessly in the train, on 
her way back to New York, she told herself that Mr. 

Mowen did not matter, that nothing mattered now, except finding somebody 
else to manufacture the switches. She was wrestling with a list of names in 
her mind, wondering who would be easiest to convince, to beg or to bribe. 

She knew, the moment she entered the anteroom of her office, that 
something had happened. She saw the unnatural stillness, with the faces of 
her staff turned to her as if her entrance were the moment they had all 
waited for, hoped for and dreaded. 

Eddie Willers rose to his feet and started toward the door of her office, 
as if knowing that she would understand and follow. She had seen his face. No 
matter what it was, she thought, she wished it had not hurt him quite so 
badly. 

"The State Science Institute, " he said quietly, when they were alone in 
her office, "has issued a statement warning people against the use of Rearden 
Metal." He added, "It was on the radio. It's in the afternoon papers." 

"What did they say?" 

"Dagny, they didn't say it! . . . They haven't really said it, yet it's 
there— and it isn't. That's what's monstrous about it." 

His effort was focused on keeping his voice quiet; he could not control 
his words. The words were forced out of him by the unbelieving. 

bewildered indignation of a child screaming in denial at his first 
encounter with evil. 

"What did they say, Eddie?" 

"They . . . You'd have to read it." He pointed to the newspaper he had 
left on her desk. "They haven't said that Rearden Metal is bad. 

They haven't said that it's unsafe. What they've done is . . ." His hands 
spread and dropped in a gesture of futility. 

She saw at a glance what they had done. She saw the sentences: "It may be 
possible that after a period of heavy usage, a sudden fissure may appear, 
though the length of this period cannot be predicted. . . . The possibility 
of a molecular reaction, at present unknown, cannot be entirely discounted. . 
. . Although the tensile strength of the metal is obviously demonstrable, 
certain questions in regard to its behavior under unusual stress are not to 
be ruled out. 

. . . Although there is no evidence to support the contention that the use 
of the metal should be prohibited, a further study of its properties would be 
of value." 

"We can't fight it. It can't be answered," Eddie was saying slowly. 

"We can't demand a retraction. We can't show them our tests or prove 
anything. They've said nothing. They haven't said a thing that could be 
refuted and embarrass them professionally. It's the job of a coward. 

You'd expect it from some con-man or blackmailer. But, Dagny! It's the 
State Science Institute!" 

She nodded silently. She stood, her eyes fixed on some point beyond the 
window. At the end of a dark street, the bulbs of an electric sign kept going 
on and off, as if winking at her maliciously. 

Eddie gathered his strength and said in the tone of a military report, 
"Taggart stock has crashed. Ben Nealy quit. The National Brotherhood of Road 
and Track Workers has forbidden its members to work on the Rio Norte Line. 
Jim has left town." 



She took her hat and coat off, walked across the room and slowly, very 
deliberately sat down at her desk. 

She noticed a large brown envelope lying before her; it bore the 
letterhead of Rearden Steel. 

"That came by special messenger, right after you left," said Eddie. 

She put her hand on the envelope, but did not open it. She knew what it 
was: the drawings of the bridge. 

After a while, she asked, "Who issued that statement?" 

Eddie glanced at her and smiled briefly, bitterly, shaking his head. 

"No," he said. "I thought of that, too. I called the Institute long 
distance and asked them. No, it was issued by the office of Dr. Floyd Ferris, 
their co-ordinator . " 

She said nothing. 

"But still! Dr. Stadler is the head of that Institute. He is the 
Institute. He must have known about it. He permitted it. If it's done, it's 
done in his name . . .Dr. Robert Stadler ... Do you remember . . . when we 
were in college . . . how we used to talk about the great names in the world 
. . . the men of pure intellect . . . and we always chose his name as one of 
them, and—" He stopped. "I'm sorry, Dagny. I know it's no use saying 
anything. Only—" 

She sat, her hand pressed to the brown envelope. 

"Dagny," he asked, his voice low, "what is happening to people? 

Why did that statement succeed? It's such an obvious smear- job, so obvious 
and so rotten. You'd think a decent person would throw it in the gutter. How 
could"— his voice was breaking in gentle, desperate, rebellious anger— "how 
could they accept it? Didn't they read it? 

Didn't they see? Don't they think? Dagny! What is it in people that lets 
them do this— and how can we live with it?" 

"Quiet, Eddie," she said, "quiet. Don't be afraid." 

The building of the State Science Institute stood over a river of New 
Hampshire, on a lonely hillside, halfway between the river and the sky. From 
a distance, it looked like a solitary monument in a virgin forest. The trees 
were carefully planted, the roads were laid out as a park, the roof tops of a 
small town could be seen in a valley some miles away. But nothing had been 
allowed to come too close and detract from the building's austerity. 

The white marble of the walls gave it a classical grandeur; the 
composition of its rectangular masses gave it the cleanliness and beauty of a 
modern plant. It was an inspired structure. From across the river, people 
looked at it with reverence and thought of it as a monument to a living man 
whose character had the nobility of the building's lines. 

Over the entrance, a dedication was cut into the marble: "To the fearless 
mind. To the inviolate truth." In a quiet aisle, in a bare corridor, a small 
brass plate, such as dozens of other name plates on other doors, said: Dr. 
Robert Stadler. 

At the age of twenty-seven, Dr. Robert Stadler had written a treatise on 
cosmic rays, which demolished most of the theories held by the scientists who 
preceded him. Those who followed, found his achievement somewhere at the base 
of any line of inquiry they undertook. 

At the age of thirty, he was recognized as the greatest physicist of his 
time. At thirty-two, he became head of the Department of Physics of the 
Patrick Henry University, in the days when the great University still 
deserved its glory. It was of Dr. Robert Stadler that a writer had said: 
"Perhaps, among the phenomena of the universe which he is studying, none is 
so miraculous as the brain of Dr. Robert Stadler himself." It was Dr. Robert 
Stadler who had once corrected a student: "Free scientific inquiry? The first 
adjective is redundant." 



At the age of forty, Dr. Robert Stadler addressed the nation, endorsing 
the establishment of a State Science Institute. "Set science free of the rule 
of the dollar," he pleaded. The issue had hung in the balance; an obscure 
group of scientists had quietly forced a bill through its long way to the 
floor of the Legislature; there had been some public hesitation about the 
bill, some doubt, an uneasiness no one could define. The name of Dr. Robert 
Stadler acted upon the country like the cosmic rays he studied: it pierced 
any barrier. The nation built the white marble edifice as a personal present 
to one of its greatest men. 

Dr. Stadler 's office at the Institute was a small room that looked like 
the office of the bookkeeper of an unsuccessful firm. There was n cheap desk 
of ugly yellow oak, a filing cabinet, two chairs, and a blackboard chalked 
with mathematical formulas. Sitting on one of the chairs against a blank 
wall, Dagny thought that the office had an air of ostentation and elegance, 
together: ostentation, because it seemed intended to suggest that the owner 
was great enough to permit himself such a setting; elegance, because he truly 
needed nothing else. 

She had met Dr. Stadler on a few occasions, at banquets given by leading 
businessmen or great engineering societies, in honor of some solemn cause or 
another. She had attended the occasions as reluctantly as he did, and had 
found that he liked to talk to her. "Miss Taggart, " 

he had said to her once, "I never expect to encounter intelligence. 

That I should find it here is such an astonishing relief!" She had come to 
his office, remembering that sentence. She sat, watching him in the manner of 
a scientist: assuming nothing, discarding emotion, seeking only to observe 
and to understand. 

"Miss Taggart," he said gaily, "I'm curious about you, I'm curious 
whenever anything upsets a precedent. As a rule, visitors are a painful duty 
to me. I'm frankly astonished that I should feel such a simple pleasure in 
seeing you here. Do you know what it's like to feel suddenly that one can 
talk without the strain of trying to force some sort of understanding out of 
a vacuum?" 

He sat on the edge of his desk, his manner gaily informal. He was not 
tall, and his slenderness gave him an air of youthful energy, almost of 
boyish zest. His thin face was ageless; it was a homely face, but the great 
forehead and the large gray eyes held such an arresting intelligence that one 
could notice nothing else. There were wrinkles of humor in the corners of the 
eyes, and faint lines of bitterness in the corners of the mouth. He did not 
look like a man in his early fifties; the slightly graying hair was his only 
sign of age. 

"Tell me more about yourself," he said. "I always meant to ask you what 
you're doing in such an unlikely career as heavy industry and how you can 
stand those people." 

"I cannot take too much of your time, Dr. Stadler." She spoke with polite, 
impersonal precision. "And the matter I came to discuss is extremely 
important . " 

He laughed. "There's a sign of the businessman— wanting to come to the 
point at once. Well, by all means. But don't worry about my time— it's yours. 
Now, what was it you said you wanted to discuss? 

Oh yes. Rearden Metal. Not exactly one of the subjects on which I'm best 
informed, but if there's anything I can do for you—" His hand moved in a 
gesture of invitation. 

"Do you know the statement issued by this Institute in regard to Rearden 
Metal?" 

He frowned slightly. "Yes, I've heard about it." 
"Have you read it?" 
"No . " 



"It was intended to prevent the use of Rearden Metal." 
"Yes, yes, I gathered that much." 
"Could you tell me why?" 

He spread his hands; they were attractive hands— long and bony, beautiful 
in their suggestion of nervous energy and strength. "I really wouldn't know. 
That is the province of Dr. Ferris. I'm sure he had his reasons. Would you 
like to speak to Dr. Ferris?" 

"No. Are you familiar with the metallurgical nature of Rearden Metal, Dr. 
Stadler?" 

"Why, yes, a little. But tell me, why are you concerned about it?" 

A flicker of astonishment rose and died in her eyes; she answered without 
change in the impersonal tone of her voice, "I am building a branch line with 
rails of Rearden Metal, which—" 

"Oh, but of course! I did hear something about it. You must forgive me, I 
don't read the newspapers as regularly as I should. It's your railroad that's 
building that new branch, isn't it?" 

"The existence of my railroad depends upon the completion of that branch— 
and, I think, " eventually, the existence of this country will depend on it as 
well." 

The wrinkles of amusement deepened about his eyes. "Can you make such a 
statement with positive assurance, Miss Taggart? I couldn't." 
"In this case?" 

"In any case. Nobody can tell what the course of a country's future may 
be. It is not a matter of calculable trends, but a chaos subject to the rule 
of the moment, in which anything is possible." 

"Do you think that production is necessary to the existence of a country, 
Dr. Stadler?" 

"Why, yes, yes, of course." 

"The building of our branch line has been stopped by the statement of this 
Institute . " 

He did not smile and he did not answer. 

"Does that statement represent your conclusion about the nature of Rearden 
Metal?" she asked. 

"I have said that I have not read it." There was an edge of sharpness in 
his voice. 

She opened her bag, took out a newspaper clipping and extended it to him. 
"Would you read it and tell me whether this is a language which science may 
properly speak?" 

He glanced through the clipping, smiled contemptuously and tossed it aside 
with a gesture of distaste. "Disgusting, isn't it?" he said. "But what can 
you do when you deal with people?" 

She looked at him, not understanding. "You do not approve of that 
statement? " 

He shrugged. "My approval or disapproval would be irrelevant." 
"Have you formed a conclusion of your own about Rearden Metal?" 
"Well, metallurgy is not exactly— what shall we say?— my specialty." 
"Have you examined any data on Rearden Metal?" 

"Miss Taggart, I don't see the point of your questions." His voice sounded 
faintly impatient. 

"I would like to know your personal verdict on Rearden Metal," 
"For what purpose?" 

"So that I may give it to the press." 
He got up. "That is quite impossible." 

She said, her voice strained with the effort of trying to force 
understanding, "I will submit to you all the information necessary to form a 
conclusive judgment." 

"I cannot issue any public statements about it." 



"Why not?" 

"The situation is much too complex to explain in a casual discussion." 
"But if you should find that Rearden Metal is, in fact, an extremely 
valuable product which—" 

"That is beside the point." 

"The value of Rearden Metal is beside the point?" 

"There are other issues involved, besides questions of fact." 

She asked, not quite believing that she had heard him right, "What other 
issues is science concerned with, besides questions of fact?" 

The bitter lines of his mouth sharpened into the suggestion of a smile. 
"Miss Taggart, you do not understand the problems of scientists." 

She said slowly, as if she were seeing it suddenly in time with her words, 
"I believe that you do know what Rearden Metal really is." 

He shrugged. "Yes. I know. From such information as I've seen, it appears 
to be a remarkable thing. Quite a brilliant achievement— as far as technology 
is concerned." He was pacing impatiently across the office. "In fact, I 
should like, some day, to order a special laboratory motor that would stand 
just such high temperatures as Rearden Metal can take. It would be very 
valuable in connection with certain phenomena I should like to observe. I 
have found that when particles are accelerated to a speed approaching the 
speed of light, they—" 

"Dr. Stadler, " she asked slowly, "you know the truth, yet you will not 
state it publicly?" 

"Miss Taggart, you are using an abstract term, when we are dealing with a 
matter of practical reality." 

"We are dealing with a matter of science." 

"Science? Aren't you confusing the standards involved? It is only in the 
realm of pure science that truth is an absolute criterion. When we deal with 
applied science, with technology— we deal with people. 

And when we deal with people, considerations other than truth enter the 
question . " 

"What considerations?" 

"I am not a technologist, Miss Taggart. I have no talent or taste for 
dealing with people. I cannot become involved in so-called practical 
matters . " 

"That statement was issued in your name." 
"I had nothing to do with it!" 

"The name of this Institute is your responsibility." 
"That's a perfectly unwarranted assumption." 

"People think that the honor of your name is the guarantee behind any 
action of this Institute." 

"I can't help what people think— if they think at all!" 
"They accepted your statement. It was a lie." 
"How can one deal in truth when one deals with the public?" 
"I don't understand you," she said very quietly. 

"Questions of truth do not enter into social issues. No principles have 
ever had any effect on society." 

"What, then, directs men's actions?" 

He shrugged. "The expediency of the moment," 

"Dr. Stadler," she said, "I think I must tell you the meaning and the 
consequences of the fact that the construction of my branch line is being 
stopped. I am stopped, in the name of public safety, because I am using the 
best rail ever produced. In six months, if I do not complete that line, the 
best industrial section of the country will be left without transportation. 
It will be destroyed, because it was the best and there were men who thought 
it expedient to seize a share of its wealth." 



"Well, that may be vicious, unjust, calamitous— but such is life in 
society. Somebody is always sacrificed, as a rule unjustly; there is no other 
way to live among men. What can any one person do?" 

"You can state the truth about Rearden Metal." 

He did not answer. 

"I could beg you to do it in order to save me. I could beg you to do it in 
order to avert a national disaster. But I won't. These may not be valid 
reasons. There is only one reason; you must say it, because it is true." 

"I was not consulted about that statement!" The cry broke out 
involuntarily. "I wouldn't have allowed it! I don't like it any better than 
you do! But I can't issue a public denial!" 

"You were not consulted? Then shouldn't you want to find out the reasons 
behind that statement?" 

"I can't destroy the Institute now!" 

"Shouldn't you want to find out the reasons?" 

"I know the reasons! They won't tell me, but I know. And I can't say that 
I blame them, either." 
"Would you tell me?" 

"I'll tell you, if you wish. It's the truth that you want, isn't it? 

Dr. Ferris cannot help it, if the morons who vote the funds for this 
Institute insist on what they call results. They are incapable of conceiving 
of such a thing as abstract science. They can judge it only in terms of the 
latest gadget it has produced for them. I do not know how Dr. Ferris has 
managed to keep this Institute in existence, I can only marvel at his 
practical ability. I don't believe he ever was a first-rate scientist— but 
what a priceless valet of science! I know that he has been facing a grave 
problem lately. He's kept me out of it, he spares me all that, but I do hear 
rumors. People have been criticizing the Institute, because, they say, we 
have not produced enough. The public has been demanding economy. In times 
like these, when their fat little comforts are threatened, you may be sure 
that science is the first thing men will sacrifice. This is the only 
establishment left. There are practically no private research foundations any 
longer. Look at the greedy ruffians who run our industries. You cannot expect 
them to support science." 

"Who is supporting you now?" she asked, her voice low. 

He shrugged. "Society." 

She said, with effort, "You were going to tell me the reasons behind that 
statement . " 

"I wouldn't think you'd find them hard to deduce. If you consider that for 
thirteen years this Institute has had a department of metallurgical research, 
which has cost over twenty million dollars and has produced nothing but a new 
silver polish and a new anti-corrosive preparation, which, I believe, is not 
so good as the old ones— you can imagine what the public reaction will be if 
some private individual comes out with a product that revolutionizes the 
entire science of metallurgy and proves to be sensationally successful!" 

Her head dropped. She said nothing. 

"I don't blame our metallurgical department!" he said angrily. "I know 
that results of this kind are not a matter of any predictable time. 

But the public won't understand it. What, then, should we sacrifice? An 
excellent piece of smelting— or the last center of science left on earth, and 
the whole future of human knowledge? That is the alternative." 

She sat, her head down. After a while, she said, "AH right, Dr. Stadler. I 
won ' t argue . " 

He saw her groping for her bag, as if she were trying to remember the 
automatic motions necessary to get up. 

"Miss Taggart, " he said quietly. It was almost a plea. She looked up. 
Her face was composed and empty. 



He came closer; he leaned with one hand against the wall above her head, 
almost as if he wished to hold her in the circle of his arm. 

"Miss Taggart, " he said, a tone of gentle, bitter persuasiveness in his 
voice, "I am older than you. Believe me, there is no other way to live on 
earth, Men are not open to truth or reason. They cannot be reached by a 
rational argument. The mind is powerless against them. Yet we have to deal 
with them. If we want to accomplish anything, we have to deceive them into 
letting us accomplish it. Or force them. They understand nothing else. We 
cannot expect their support for any endeavor of the intellect, for any goal 
of the spirit. They are nothing but vicious animals. They are greedy, self- 
indulgent, predatory dollar-chasers who—" 

"I am one of the dollar-chasers, Dr. Stadler, " she said, her voice low. 

"You are an unusual, brilliant child who has not seen enough of life to 
grasp the full measure of human stupidity. I've fought it all my life. 

I'm very tired. . . ." The sincerity of his voice was genuine. He walked 
slowly away from her. "There was a time when I looked at the tragic mess 
they've made of this earth, and I wanted to cry out, to beg them to listen— I 
could teach them to live so much better than they did— but there was nobody to 
hear me, they had nothing to hear me with. . . . 

Intelligence? It is such a rare, precarious spark that flashes for a 
moment somewhere among men, and vanishes. One cannot tell its nature, or its 
future ... or its death. ..." 

She made a movement to rise. 

"Don't go, Miss Taggart. I'd like you to understand." 

She raised her face to him, in obedient indifference. Her face was not 
pale, but its planes stood out with strangely naked precision, as if its skin 
had lost the shadings of color. 

"You're young," he said. "At your age, I had the same faith in the 
unlimited power of reason. The same brilliant vision of man as a rational 
being. I have seen so much, since. I have been disillusioned so often. . . . 
I'd like to tell you just one story." 

He stood at the window of his office. It had grown dark outside. The 
darkness seemed to rise from the black cut of the river, far below. A few 
lights trembled in the water, from among the hills of the other shore. The 
sky was still the intense blue of evening. A lonely star, low over the earth, 
seemed unnaturally large and made the sky look darker. 

"When I was at the Patrick Henry University," he said, "I had three 
pupils. I have had many bright students in the past, but these three were- 
the kind of reward a teacher prays for. If ever you could wish to receive the 
gift of the human mind at its best, young and delivered into your hands for 
guidance, they were this gift. Theirs was the kind of intelligence one 
expects to see, in the future, changing the course of the world. They came 
from very different backgrounds, but they were inseparable friends. They made 
a strange choice of studies. They majored in two sub j ects— mine and Hugh 
Akston's. Physics and philosophy. It is not a combination of interests one 
encounters nowadays. Hugh Akston was a distinguished man, a great mind . . . 
unlike the incredible creature whom that University has now put in his place. 
. . . Akston and I were a little jealous of each other over these three 
students. It was a kind of contest between us, a friendly contest, because we 
understood each other, I heard Akston saying one day that he regarded them as 
his sons. I resented it a little . . . because I thought of them as mine. . . 

He turned and looked at her. The bitter lines of age were visible now, 
cutting across his cheeks. He said, "When I endorsed the establishment of 
this Institute, one of these three damned me. I have not seen him since. It 
used to disturb me, in the first few years. I wondered, once in a while, 
whether he had been right. ... It has ceased to disturb me, long ago." 



He smiled. There was nothing but bitterness now, in his smile and his 
face . 

'These three men, these three who held all the hope which the gift of 
intelligence ever proffered, these three from whom we expected such a 
magnificent future— one of them was Francisco d'Anconia, who became a depraved 
playboy. Another was Ragnar Danneskjold, who became a plain bandit. So much 
for the promise of the human mind." 

"Who was the third one?" she asked, He shrugged. "The third one did not 
achieve even that sort of notorious distinction. He vanished without a trace— 
into the great unknown of mediocrity. He is probably a second assistant 
bookkeeper somewhere." 

"It's a lie! I didn't run away!" cried James Taggart. "I came here because 
I happened to be sick. Ask Dr. Wilson. It's a form of flu. 

He'll prove it. And how did you know that I was here?" 

Dagny stood in the middle of the room; there were melting snowflakes on 
her coat collar, on the brim of her hat. She glanced around, feeling an 
emotion that would have been sadness, had she had time to acknowledge it. 

It was a room in the house of the old Taggart estate on the Hudson. 

Jim had inherited the place, but he seldom came here. In their childhood, 
this had been their father's study. Now it had the desolate air of a room 
which is used, yet uninhabited. There were slipcovers on all but two chairs, 
a cold fireplace and the dismal warmth of an electric heater with a cord 
twisting across the floor, a desk, its glass surface empty. 

Jim lay on the couch, with a towel wrapped for a scarf around his neck. 
She saw a stale, filled ashtray on a chair beside him, a bottle of whisky, a 
wilted paper cup, and two-day-old newspapers scattered about the floor. A 
portrait of their grandfather hung over the fireplace, full figure, with a 
railroad bridge in the fading background. 

"I have no time for arguments, Jim." 

"It was your idea! I hope you'll admit to the Board that it was your idea. 
That's what your goddamn Rearden Metal has done to us! If we had waited for 
Orren Boyle . . ." His unshaved face was pulled by a twisted scramble of 
emotions: panic, hatred, a touch of triumph, the relief of screaming at a 
victim— and the faint, cautious, begging look that sees a hope of help. 

He had stopped tentatively, but she did not answer. She stood watching 
him, her hands in the pockets of her coat. 

"There's nothing we can do now!" he moaned. "I tried to call Washington, 
to get them to seize the Phoenix-Durango and turn it over to us, on the 
ground of emergency, but they won't even discuss it! Too many people 
objecting, they say, afraid of some fool precedent or another! ... I got 
the National Alliance of Railroads to suspend the deadline and permit Dan 
Conway to operate his road for another year —that would have given us time- 
but he's refused to do it! I tried to get Ellis Wyatt and his bunch of 
friends in Colorado to demand that Washington order Conway to continue 
operations— but all of them, Wyatt and all the rest of those bastards, 
refused! It's their skin, worse than ours, they're sure to go down the drain- 
but they've refused!" 

She smiled briefly, but made no comment. 

"Now there's nothing left for us to do! We're caught. We can't give up 
that branch and we can't complete it. We can't stop or go on. We have no 
money. Nobody will touch us with a ten-foot pole! What have we got left 
without the Rio Norte Line? But we can't finish it. We'd be boycotted. We'd 
be blacklisted. That union of track workers would sue us. They would, there's 
a law about it. We can't complete that Line! Christ! What are we going to 
do?" 

She waited. "Through, Jim?" she asked coldly. "If you are, I'll tell you 
what we're going to do." 



He kept silent, looking up at her from under his heavy eyelids. 

"This is not a proposal, Jim. It's an ultimatum. Just listen and accept. I 
am going to complete the construction of the Rio Norte Line. 

I personally, not Taggart Transcontinental. I will take a leave of absence 
from the job of Vice-President. I will form a company in my own name. Your 
Board will turn the Rio None Line over to me. I will act as my own 
contractor. I will get my own financing. I will take full charge and sole 
responsibility. I will complete the Line on time. After you have seen how the 
Rearden Metal rails can take it, I will transfer the Line back to Taggart 
Transcontinental and I'll return to my job. That is all," 

He was looking at her silently, dangling a bedroom slipper on the tip of 
his foot. She had never supposed that hope could look ugly in a man's face, 
but it did: it was mixed with cunning. She turned her eyes away from him, 
wondering how it was possible that a man's first thought in such a moment 
could be a search for something to put over on her. 

Then, preposterously, the first thing he said, his voice anxious, was, 
"But who will run Taggart Transcontinental in the meantime?" 

She chuckled; the sound astonished her, it seemed old in its bitterness. 

She said, "Eddie Willers." 

"Oh no ! He couldn ' t ! " 

She laughed, in the same brusque, mirthless way. "I thought you were 
smarter than I about things of this kind. Eddie will assume the title of 
Acting Vice-President. He will occupy my office and sit at my desk. 

But who do you suppose will run Taggart Transcontinental?" 

"But I don't see how—" 

"I will commute by plane between Eddie's office and Colorado. Also, there 
are long-distance phones available. I will do just what I have been doing. 
Nothing will change, except the kind of show you will put on for your friends 
. . . and the fact that it will be a little harder for me." 

"What show?" 

"You understand me, Jim. I have no idea what sort of games you're tangled 
in, you and your Board of Directors. I don't know how many ends you're all 
playing against the middle and against one another, or how many pretenses you 
have to keep up in how many opposite directions. I don't know or care. You 
can all hide behind me. 

If you're all afraid, because you've made deals with friends who ' re 
threatened by Rearden Metal— well, here's your chance to go through the 
motions of assuring them that you're not involved, that you're not doing 
this— I am. You can help them to curse me and denounce me. 

You can all stay home, take no risks and make no enemies. Just keep out of 
my way . " 

"Well . . ."he said slowly, "of course, the problems involved in the 
policy of a great railroad system are complex . . . while a small, 
independent company, in the name of one person, could afford to—" 

"Yes, Jim, yes, I know all that. The moment you announce that you're 
turning the Rio Norte Line over to me, the Taggart stock will rise. The 
bedbugs will stop crawling from out of unlikely corners, since they won't 
have the incentive of a big company to bite. Before they decide what to do 
about me, I will have the Line finished. And as for me, I don't want to have 
you and your Board to account to, to argue with, to beg permissions from. 
There isn't any time for that, if I am to do the kind of job that has to be 
done. So I'm going to do it alone." 

"And ... if you fail?" 

"If I fail, I'll go down alone." 

"You understand that in such case Taggart Transcontinental wilt not be 
able to help you in any way?" 
"I understand." 



"You will not count on us?" 
"No . " 

"You will cut all official connection with us, so that your activities 
will not reflect upon our reputation?" 
"Yes . " 

"I think we should agree that in case of failure or public scandal . . . 
your leave of absence will become permanent . . . that is, you will not 
expect to return to the post of Vice-President." 

She closed her eyes for a moment. "All right, Jim. In such case, I will 
not return . " 

"Before we transfer the Rio Norte Line to you, we must have a written 
agreement that you will transfer it back to us, along with your controlling 
interest at cost, in case the Line becomes successful. Otherwise you might 
try to squeeze us for a windfall profit, since we need that Line." 

There was only a brief stab of shock in her eyes, then she said 
indifferently, the words sounding as if she were tossing alms, "By all means, 
Jim. Have that stated in writing." 

"Now as to your temporary successor . . ." 

"Yes?" 

"You don't really want it to be Eddie Willers, do you?" 
"Yes. I do." 

"But he couldn't even act like a vice-president! He doesn't have the 
presence, the manner, the—" 

"He knows his work and mine. He knows what I want. I trust him. 
I'll be able to work with him." 

"Don't you think it would be better to pick one of our more distinguished 
young men, somebody from a good family, with more social poise and—" 
"It's going to be Eddie Willers, Jim." 

He sighed. "All right. Only . . . only we must be careful about it. 

. . . We don't want people to suspect that it's you who ' re still running 
Taggart Transcontinental. Nobody must know it." 

"Everybody will know it, Jim. But since nobody will admit it openly, 
everybody will be satisfied." 

"But we must preserve appearances." 

"Oh, certainly! You don't have to recognize me on the street, if you don't 
want to. You can say you've never seen me before and I'll say I've never 
heard of Taggart Transcontinental." 

He remained silent, trying to think, staring down at the floor. 

She turned to look at the grounds beyond the window. The sky had the even, 
gray-white pallor of winter. Far below, on the shore of the Hudson, she saw 
the road she used to watch for Francisco's car- 
she saw the cliff over the river, where they climbed to look for the 
towers of New York— and somewhere beyond the woods were the trails that led to 
Rockdale Station. The earth was snow-covered now, and what remained was like 
the skeleton of the countryside she remembered— a thin design of bare branches 
rising from the snow to the sky. 

It was gray and white, like a photograph, a dead photograph which one 
keeps hopefully for remembrance, but which has no power to bring back 
anything . 

"What are you going to call it?" 

She turned, startled. "What?" 

"What are you going to call your company?" 

"Oh . . . Why, the Dagny Taggart Line, I guess." 

"But ... Do you think that's wise? It might be misunderstood. 
The Taggart might be taken as—" 

"Well, what do you want me to call it?" she snapped, worn down to anger. 
"The Miss Nobody? The Madam X? The John Gait?" She stopped. She smiled 



suddenly, a cold, bright, dangerous smile. 'That's what I'm going to call it: 
the John Gait Line." 

"Good God, no!" 

"Yes." 

"But it's . . . if s just a cheap piece of slang!" 

"You can't make a joke out of such a serious project! . . . You can't be 
so vulgar and . . . and undignified!" 
"Can't I?" 

"But for God's sake, why?" 

"Because it's going to shock all the rest of them just as it shocked you." 
"I've never seen you playing for effects." 
"I am, this time." 

"But . . ." His voice dropped to an almost superstitious sound: "Look, 
Dagny, you know, it's . . . it's bad luck. . . . What it stands for is . . ." 
He stopped. 

"What does it stand for?" 

"I don't know . . . But the way people use it, they always seem to say it 
out of-" 

"Fear? Despair? Futility?" 

"Yes . . . yes, that's what it is." 

"That's what I want to throw in their faces!" 

The bright, sparkling anger in her eyes, her first look of enjoyment, made 
him understand that he had to keep still. 

"Draw up all the papers and all the red tape in the name of the John Gait 
Line," she said. 

He sighed. "Well, it's your Line." 

"You bet it is ! " 

He glanced at her, astonished. She had dropped the manners and style of a 
vice-president; she seemed to be relaxing happily to the level of yard crews 
and construction gangs. 

"As to the papers and the legal side of it, " he said, "there might be some 
difficulties. We would have to apply for the permission of—" 

She whirled to face him. Something of the bright, violent look still 
remained in her face. But it was not gay and she was not smiling. The look 
now had an odd, primitive quality. When he saw it, he hoped he would never 
have to see it again. 

"Listen, Jim," she said; he had never heard that tone in any human voice. 
"There is one thing you can do as your part of the deal and you'd better do 
it: keep your Washington boys off. See to it that they give me all the 
permissions, authorizations, charters and other waste paper that their laws 
require. Don't let them try to stop me. If they try . . . Jim, people say 
that our ancestor, Nat Taggart, killed a politician who tried to refuse him a 
permission he should never have had to ask. I don't know whether Nat Taggart 
did it or not. But I'll tell you this: I know how he felt, if he did. If he 
didn't— I might do the job for him, to complete the family legend. I mean it, 
Jim. " 

Francisco d'Anconia sat in front of her desk. His face was blank. It had 
remained blank while Dagny explained to him, in the clear, impersonal tone of 
a business interview, the formation and purpose of her own railroad company. 
He had listened. He had not pronounced a word. 

She had never seen his face wear that look of drained passivity. 

There was no mockery, no amusement, no antagonism; it was as if he did not 
belong in these particular moments of existence and could not be reached. Yet 
his eyes looked at her attentively; they seemed to see more than she could 
suspect; they made her think of one-way glass: they let all light rays in, 
but none out . 



"Francisco, I asked you to come here, because I wanted you to see me in my 
office. You've never seen it. It would have meant something to you, once." 

His eyes moved slowly to look at the office. Its walls were bare, except 
for three things: a map of Taggart Transcontinental— the original drawing of 
Nat Taggart, that had served as model for his statue —and a large railroad 
calendar, in cheerfully crude colors, the kind that was distributed each 
year, with a change of its picture, to every station along the Taggart track, 
the kind that had hung once in her first work place at Rockdale. 

He got up. He said quietly, "Dagny, for your own sake, and"— it was a 
barely perceptible hesitation— "and in the name of any pity you might feel for 
me, don't request what you're going to request. 

Don't. Let me go now." 

This was not like him and like nothing she could ever have expected to 
hear from him. After a moment, she asked, "Why?" 

"I can't answer you. I can't answer any questions. That is one of the 
reasons why it's best not to discuss it." 

"You know what I am going to request?" 

"Yes." The way she looked at him was such an eloquent, desperate question, 
that he had to add, "I know that I am going to refuse." 
"Why?" 

He smiled mirthlessly, spreading his hands out, as if to show her that 
this was what he had predicted and had wanted to avoid. 

She said quietly, "I have to try, Francisco. I have to make the request. 
That's my part. What you'll do about it is yours. But I'll know that I've 
tried everything." 

He remained standing, but he inclined his head a little, in assent, and 
said, "I will listen, if that will help you." 

"I need fifteen million dollars to complete the Rio Norte Line, I have 
obtained seven million against the Taggart stock I own free and clear. I can 
raise nothing else. I will issue bonds in the name of my new company, in the 
amount of eight million dollars. I called you here to ask you to buy these 
bonds . " 

He did not answer. 

"I am simply a beggar, Francisco, and I am begging you for money. 

I had always thought that one did not beg in business. I thought that one 
stood on the merit of what one had to offer, and gave value for value. This 
is not so any more, though I don't understand how we can act on any other 
rule and continue to exist. Judging by every objective fact, the Rio Norte 
Line is to be the best railroad in the country. Judging by every known 
standard, it is the best investment possible. And that is what damns me. I 
cannot raise money by offering people a good business venture: the fact that 
it's good, makes people reject it. There is no bank that would buy the bonds 
of my company. 

So I can't plead merit. I can only plead." 

Her voice was pronouncing the words with impersonal precision. She 
stopped, waiting for his answer. He remained silent. 

"I know that I have nothing to offer you," she said. "I can't speak to you 
in terms of investment. You don't care to make money. Industrial projects 
have ceased to concern you long ago. So I won't pretend that it's a fair 
exchange. It's just begging." She drew her breath and said, "Give me that 
money as alms, because it means nothing to you." 

"Don't," he said, his voice low. She could not tell whether the strange 
sound of it was pain or anger; his eyes were lowered. 

"Will you do it, Francisco?" 

"No . " 

After a moment, she said, "I called you, not because I thought you would 
agree, but because you were the only one who could understand what I am 



saying. So I had to try it." Her voice was dropping lower, as if she hoped it 
would make emotion harder to detect. "You see, I can't believe that you're 
really gone . . . because I know that you're still able to hear me. The way 
you live is depraved. But the way you act is not. Even the way you speak of 
it, is not. ... I had to try . . . 

But I can't struggle to understand you any longer." 

"I'll give you a hint. Contradictions do not exist. Whenever you think 
that you are facing a contradiction, check your premises. You will find that 
one of them is wrong." 

"Francisco," she whispered, "why don't you tell me what it was that 
happened to you?" 

"Because, at this moment, the answer would hurt you more than the doubt." 
"Is it as terrible as that?" 

"It is an answer which you must reach by yourself." 

She shook her head. "I don't know what to offer you. I don't know what is 
of value to you any longer. Don't you see that even a beggar has to give 
value in return, has to offer some reason why you might want to help him? . . 
. Well, I thought ... at one time, it meant a great deal to you— success. 
Industrial success. Remember how we used to talk about it? You were very 
severe. You expected a lot from me. 

You told me I'd better live up to it. I have. You wondered how far I'd 
rise with Taggart Transcontinental." She moved her hand, pointing at the 
office. "This is how far I've risen. . . . So I thought ... if the memory 
of what had been your values still has some meaning for you, if only as 
amusement, or a moment's sadness, or just like . . . like putting flowers on 
a grave . . . you might want to give me the money ... in the name of that." 

"No . " 

She said, with effort, "That money would mean nothing to you— you've wasted 
that much on senseless parties— you ' ve wasted much more on the San Sebastian 
Mines—" 

He glanced up. He looked straight at her and she saw the first spark of a 
living response in his eyes, a look that was bright, pitiless and, 
incredibly, proud: as if this were an accusation that gave him strength. 

"Oh, yes," she said slowly, as if answering his thought, "I realize that. 
I've damned you for those mines, I've denounced you, I've thrown my contempt 
at you in every way possible, and now I come back to you— for money. Like Jim, 
like any moocher you've ever met. I know it's a triumph for you, I know that 
you can laugh at me and despise me with full justice. Well— perhaps I can 
offer you that. If it's amusement that you want, if you enjoyed seeing Jim 
and the Mexican planners crawl— wouldn ' t it amuse you to break me? Wouldn't it 
give you pleasure? Don't you want to hear me acknowledge that I'm beaten by 
you? Don't you want to see me crawling before you? Tell me what form of it 
you'd like and I'll submit." 

He moved so swiftly that she could not notice how he started; it only 
seemed to her that his first movement was a shudder. He came around the desk, 
he took her hand and raised it to his lips. It began as a gesture of the 
gravest respect, as if its purpose were to give her strength; but as he held 
his lips, then his face, pressed to her hand, she knew that he was seeking 
strength from it himself. 

He dropped her hand, he looked down at her face, at the frightened 
stillness of her eyes, he smiled, not trying to hide that his smile held 
suffering, anger and tenderness. 

"Dagny, you want to crawl? You don't know what the word means and never 
will. One doesn't crawl by acknowledging it as honestly as that. Don't you 
suppose I know that your begging me was the bravest thing you could do? But . 
. . Don't ask me, Dagny." 



"In the name of anything I ever meant to you . . . " she whispered, 
"anything left within you . . . " 

In the moment when she thought that she had seen this look before, that 
this was the way he had looked against the night glow of the city, when he 
lay in bed by her side for the last time— she heard his cry, the kind of cry 
she had never torn from him before: "My love, I can't!" 

Then, as they looked at each other, both shocked into silence by 
astonishment, she saw the change in his face. It was as crudely abrupt as if 
he had thrown a switch. He laughed, he moved away from her and said, his 
voice jarringly offensive by being completely casual: "Please excuse the 
mixture in styles of expression. I've been supposed to say that to so many 
women, but on somewhat different occasions." 

Her head dropped, she sat huddled tight together, not caring that he saw 

it. 

When she raised her head, she looked at him indifferently. "All right, 
Francisco. It was a good act. I did believe it. If that was your own way of 
having the kind of fun I was offering you, you succeeded. 

I won't ask you for anything." 

"I warned you." 

"I didn't know which side you belonged on. It didn't seem possible —but 
it's the side of Orren Boyle and Bertram Scudder and your old teacher." 
"My old teacher?" he asked sharply. 
"Dr. Robert Stadler." 

He chuckled, relieved. "Oh, that one? He's the looter who thinks that his 
end justifies his seizure of my means." He added, "You know, Dagny, I'd like 
you to remember which side you said I'm on. Some day, I'll remind you of it 
and ask you whether you'll want to repeat it." 

"You won't have to remind me." 

He turned to go. He tossed his hand in a casual salute and said, "If it 
could be built, I'd wish good luck to the Rio Norte Line." 

"It's going to be built. And it's going to be called the John Gait Line." 
"What? ! " 

It was an actual scream; she chuckled derisively. "The John Gait Line." 
"Dagny, in heaven's name, why?" 
"Don't you like it?" 

"How did you happen to choose that?" 

"It sounds better than Mr. Nemo or Mr. Zero, doesn't it?" 

"Dagny, why that?" 

"Because it frightens you." 

"What do you think it stands for?" 

"The impossible. The unattainable. And you're all afraid of my Line just 
as you're afraid of that name." 

He started laughing. He laughed, not looking at her, and she felt 
strangely certain that he had forgotten her, that he was far away, that he 
was laughing— in furious gaiety and bitterness— at something in which she had 
no part. 

When he turned to her, he said earnestly, "Dagny, I wouldn't, if I were 
you . " 

She shrugged. "Jim didn't like it, either." 
"What do you like about it?" 

"I hate it! I hate the doom you're all waiting for, the giving up, and 
that senseless question that always sounds like a cry for help. I'm sick of 
hearing pleas for John Gait. I'm going to fight him." 

He said quietly, "You are." 

"I'm going to build a railroad line for him. Let him come and claim it!" 
He smiled sadly and nodded: "He will." 



The glow of poured steel streamed across the ceiling and broke against one 
wall. Rearden sat at his desk, in the light of a single lamp. Beyond its 
circle, the darkness of the office blended with the darkness outside. He felt 
as if it were empty space where the rays of the furnaces moved at will; as if 
the desk were a raft hanging in mid-air, holding two persons imprisoned in 
privacy. Dagny sat in front of his desk. 

She had thrown her coat off, and she sat outlined against it, a slim, 
tense body in a gray suit, leaning diagonally across the wide armchair. 

Only her hand lay in the light, on the edge of the desk; beyond it, he saw 
the pale suggestion of her face, the white of a blouse, the triangle of an 
open collar. 

"All right, Hank," she said, "we're going ahead with a new Rearden Metal 
bridge. This is the official order of the official owner of the John Gait 
Line. " 

He smiled, looking down at the drawings of the bridge spread in the light 
on his desk. "Have you had a chance to examine the scheme we submitted?" 
"Yes. You don't need my comments or compliments. The order says it." 
"Very well. Thank you. I'll start rolling the Metal" 

"Don't you want to ask whether the John Gait Line is in a position to 
place orders or to function?" 

"I don't need to. Your coming here says it," 

She smiled. "True. It's all set, Hank. I came to tell you that and to 
discuss the details of the bridge in person." 

"All right, I am curious: who are the bondholders of the John Gait Line?" 

"I don't think any of them could afford it. All of them have growing 
enterprises. All of them needed their money for their own concerns. 

But they needed the Line and they did not ask anyone for help." She took a 
paper out of her bag. "Here's John Gait, Inc.," she said, handing it across 
the desk. 

He knew most of the names on the list: "Ellis.. Wyatt, Wyatt Oil, 
Colorado. Ted Nielsen, Nielsen Motors, Colorado. Lawrence Hammond, Hammond 
Cars, Colorado. Andrew Stockton, Stockton Foundry, Colorado." There were a 
few from other states; he noticed the name: "Kenneth Danagger, Danagger Coal, 
Pennsylvania." The amounts of their subscriptions varied, from sums in five 
figures to six. 

He reached for his fountain pen, wrote at the bottom of the list "Henry 
Rearden, Rearden Steel, Pennsylvania— $ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 " and tossed the list back to 
her . 

"Hank," she said quietly, "I didn't want you- in on this. You've invested 
so much in Rearden Metal that it's worse for you than for any of us. You 
can't afford another risk." 

"I never accept favors," he answered coldly. 

"What do you mean?" 

"I don't ask people to take greater chances on my ventures than I take 
myself. If it's a gamble, I'll match anybody's gambling. Didn't you say that 
that track was my first showcase?" 

She inclined her head and said gravely, "All right. Thank you." 

"Incidentally, I don't expect to lose this money. I am aware of the 
conditions under which these bonds can be converted into stock at my option. 
I therefore expect to make an inordinate profit— and you're going to earn it 
for me." 

She laughed. "God, Hank, I've spoken to so many yellow fools that they've 
almost infected me into thinking of the Line as of a hopeless loss! Thanks 
for reminding me. Yes, I think I'll earn your inordinate profit for you." 

"If it weren't for the yellow fools, there wouldn't be any risk in it at 
all. But we have to beat them. We will." He reached for two telegrams from 



among the papers on his desk. "There are still a few men in existence." He 
extended the telegrams. "I think you'd like to see these." 

One of them read: "I had intended to undertake it in two years, but the 
statement of the State Science Institute compels me to proceed at once. 
Consider this a commitment for the construction of a 12inch pipe line of 
Rearden Metal, 600 miles, Colorado to Kansas City. 

Details follow. Ellis Wyatt." 

The other read: "Re our discussion of my order. Go ahead. Ken Danagger." 
He added, in explanation, "He wasn't prepared to proceed at once, either. 
It's eight thousand tons of Rearden Metal. Structural metal. 
For coal mines." 

They glanced at each other and smiled. They needed no further comment. 

He glanced down, as she handed the telegrams back to him. The skin of her 
hand looked transparent in the light, on the edge of his desk, a young girl's 
hand with long, thin fingers, relaxed for a moment, defenseless. 

"The Stockton Foundry in Colorado, " she said, "is going to finish that 
order for me— the one that the Amalgamated Switch and Signal Company ran out 
on. They're going to get in touch with you about the Metal." 

"They have already. What have you done about the construction crews?" 

"Nealy's engineers are staying on, the best ones, those I need. And most 
of the foremen, too. It won't be too hard to keep them going. 

Nealy wasn't of much use, anyway." 

"What about labor?" 

"More applicants than I can hire. I don't think the union is going to 
interfere. Most of the applicants are giving phony names. They're union 
members. They need the work desperately. I'll have a few guards on the Line, 
but I don't expect any trouble." 

"What about your brother Jim's Board of Directors?" 

"They're all scrambling to get statements into the newspapers to the 
effect that they have no connection whatever with the John Gait Line and how 
reprehensible an undertaking they think it is. They agreed to everything I 
asked. " 

The line of her shoulders looked taut, yet thrown back easily, as if 
poised for flight. Tension seemed natural to her, not a sign of anxiety, but 
a sign of enjoyment; the tension of her whole body, under the gray suit, 
half-visible in the darkness, "Eddie Willers has taken over the office of 
Operating Vice-President, " 

she said. "If you need anything, get in touch with him. I'm leaving for 
Colorado tonight." 

"Tonight?" 

"Yes. We have to make up time. We've lost a week." 
"Flying your own plane?" 

"Yes. I'll be back in about ten days, I intend to be in New York once or 
twice a month." 

"Where will you live out there?" 

"On the site. In my own railway car— that is, Eddie's car, which I'm 
borrowing . " 

"Will you be safe?" 

"Safe from what?" Then she laughed, startled. "Why, Hank, it's the first 
time you've ever thought that I wasn't a man. Of coarse I'll be safe." 

He was not looking at her; he was looking at a sheet of figures on his 
desk. "I've had my engineers prepare a breakdown of the cost of the bridge," 
he said, "and an approximate schedule of the construction time required. That 
is what I wanted to discuss with you." He extended the papers. She settled 
back to read them. 



A wedge of light fell across her face. He saw the firm, sensual mouth in 
sharp outline. Then she leaned back a little, and he saw only a suggestion of 
its shape and the dark lines of her lowered lashes. 

Haven't I?— he thought. Haven't I thought of it since the first time I saw 
you? Haven't I thought of nothing else for two years? ... He sat 
motionless, looking at her. He heard the words he had never allowed himself 
to form, the words he had felt, known, yet had not faced, had hoped to 
destroy by never letting them be said within his own mind. Now it was as 
sudden and shocking as if he were saying it to her. . . . Since the first 
time I saw you . . . Nothing but your body, that mouth of yours, and the way 
your eyes would look at me, if . . . Through every sentence I ever said to 
you, through every conference you thought so safe, through the importance of 
all the issues we discussed . . . You trusted me, didn't you? To recognize 
your greatness? To think of you as you deserved— as if you were a man? 

. . . Don't you suppose I know how much I've betrayed? The only bright 
encounter of my life— the only person I respected— the best businessman I know— 
my ally— my partner in a desperate battle . . . 

The lowest of all desires— as my answer to the highest I've met . . . 

Do you know what I am? I thought of it, because it should have been 
unthinkable. For that degrading need, which should never touch you, I have 
never wanted anyone but you ... I hadn't known what it was like, to want 
it, until I saw you for the first time. I had thought: Not I, I couldn't be 
broken by it . . . Since then . . . for two years . . . with not a moment's 
respite ... Do you know what it's like, to want it? Would you wish to hear 
what I thought when I looked at you . . . when I lay awake at night . . . 
when I heard your voice over a telephone wire . . . when I worked, but could 
not drive it away? 

. . . To bring you down to things you can't conceive— and to know that it's 
I who have done it. To reduce you to a body, to teach you an animal's 
pleasure, to see you need it, to see you asking me for it, to see your 
wonderful spirit dependent upon the obscenity of your need. To watch you as 
you are, as you face the world with your clean, proud strength— then to see 
you, in my bed, submitting to any infamous whim I may devise, to any act 
which I'll perform for the sole purpose of watching your dishonor and to 
which you'll submit for the sake of an unspeakable sensation ... I want 
you— and may I be damned for it! . . . 

She was reading the papers, leaning back in the darkness— he saw the 
reflection of the fire touching her hair, moving to her shoulder, down her 
arm, to the naked skin of her wrist. 

. . . Do you know what I'm thinking now, in this moment? . . . 
Your gray suit and your open collar . . . you look so young, so austere, 
so sure of yourself . . . What would you be like if I knocked your head back, 
if I threw you down in that formal suit of yours, if I raised your skirt- 
She glanced up at him. He looked down at the papers on his desk. 
In a moment, he said, "The actual cost of the bridge is less than our 
original estimate. You will note that the strength of the bridge allows for 
the eventual addition of a second track, which, I think, that section of the 
country will justify in a very few years. If you spread the cost over a 
period of—" 

He spoke, and she looked at his face in the lamplight, against the black 
emptiness of the office. The lamp was outside her field of vision, and she 
felt as if it were his face that illuminated the papers on the desk. His 
face, she thought, and the cold, radiant clarity of his voice, of his mind, 
of Ms drive to a single purpose. The face was like his words— as if the line 
of a single theme ran from the steady glance of the eyes, through the gaunt 
muscles of the cheeks, to the faintly scornful, downward curve of the mouth— 
the line of a ruthless asceticism. 



The day began with the news of a disaster: a freight train of the Atlantic 
Southern had crashed head-on into a passenger train, in New Mexico, on a 
sharp curve in the mountains, scattering freight cars all over the slopes. 
The cars carried five thousand tons of copper, bound from a mine in Arizona 
to the Rearden mills, Rearden telephoned the general manager of the Atlantic 
Southern, but the answer he received was: "Oh God, Mr. Rearden, how can we 
tell? How can anybody tell how long it will take to clear that wreck? 

One of the worst we've ever had ... I don't know, Mr. Rearden. 

There are no other lines anywhere in that section. The track is torn for 
twelve hundred feet. There's been a rockslide. Our wrecking train can't get 
through. I don't know how we'll ever get those freight cars back on rails, or 
when. Can't expect it sooner than two weeks . . . 

Three days? Impossible, Mr. Rearden! . . . But we can't help it! 

. . . But surely you can tell your customers that it's an act of God! 

What if you do hold them up? Nobody can blame you in a case of this kind!" 

In the next two hours, with the assistance of his secretary, two young 
engineers from his shipping department, a road map, and the long-distance 
telephone, Rearden arranged for a fleet of trucks to proceed to the scene of 
the wreck, and for a chain of hopper cars to meet them at the nearest station 
of the Atlantic Southern. The hopper cars had been borrowed from Taggart 
Transcontinental. The trucks had been recruited from all over New Mexico, 
Arizona and Colorado. Rearden 's engineers had hunted by telephone for private 
truck owners and had offered payments that cut all arguments short. 

It was the third of three shipments of copper that Rearden. had expected; 
two orders had not been delivered: one company had gone out of business, the 
other was still pleading delays that it could not help. 

He had attended to the matter without breaking his chain of appointments, 
without raising his voice, without sign of strain, uncertainty or 
apprehension; he had acted with the swift precision of a military commander 
under sudden fire— and Gwen Ives, his secretary, had acted as his calmest 
lieutenant. She was a girl in her late twenties, whose quietly harmonious, 
impenetrable face had a quality matching the best designed office equipment; 
she was one of his most ruthlessly competent employees; her manner of 
performing her duties suggested the kind of rational cleanliness that would 
consider any element of emotion, while at work, as an unpardonable 
immorality . 

When the emergency was over, her sole comment was, "Mr. Rearden, I think 
we should ask all our suppliers to ship via Taggart Transcontinental." "I'm 
thinking that, too," he answered; then added, "Wire Fleming in Colorado. Tell 
him I'm taking an option on that copper mine property." 

He was back at his desk, speaking to his superintendent on one phone and 
to his purchasing manager on another, checking every date and ton of ore on 
hand— he could not leave to chance or to another person the possibility of a 
single hour's delay in the flow of a furnace: it was the last of the rail for 
the John Gait Line that was being poured— when the buzzer rang and Miss Ives' 
voice announced that his mother was outside, demanding to see him. 

He had asked his family never to come to the mills without appointment. He 
had been glad that they hated the place and seldom appeared in his office. 
What he now felt was a violent impulse to order his mother off the premises. 
Instead, with a greater effort than the problem of the train wreck had 
required of him, he said quietly, "All right. Ask her to come in." 

His mother came in with an air of belligerent def ensiveness . She looked at 
his office as if she knew what it meant to him and as if she were declaring 
her resentment against anything being of greater importance to him than her 
own person. She took a long time settling down in an armchair, arranging and 
rearranging her bag, her gloves, the folds of her dress, while droning, "It's 



a fine thing when a mother has to wait in an anteroom and ask permission of a 
stenographer before she's allowed to see her own son who—" 

"Mother, is it anything important? I am very rushed today." 

"You're not the only one who's got problems. Of course, it's important. Do 
you think I'd go to the trouble of driving way 
out here, if it wasn't important?" 
"What is it?" 
"It's about Philip." 
"Yes?" 

"Philip is unhappy." 
"Well?" 

"He feels it's not right that he should have to depend on your charity and 
live on handouts and never be able to count on a single dollar of his own." 

"Well!" he said with a startled smile. "I've been waiting for him to 
realize that." 

"It isn't right for a sensitive man to be in such a position." 
"It certainly isn't." 

"I'm glad you agree with me. So what you have to do is give him a job." 
"A . . . what?" 

"You must give him a job, here, at the mills— but a nice, clean job, of 
course, with a desk and an office and a decent salary, where he wouldn't have 
to be among your day laborers and your smelly furnaces." 

He knew that he was hearing it; he could not make himself believe it. 
"Mother, you're not serious." 

"I certainly am. I happen to know that that's what he wants, only 's too 
proud to ask you for it But if you offer it to him and make it look like it's 
you who ' re asking him a favor— why, I know he'd be happy to take it. That's 
why I had to come here to talk to you— so he wouldn't guess that I put you up 
to it." 

It was not in the nature of his consciousness to understand the nature of 
the things he was hearing. A single thought cut through his mind like a 
spotlight, making him unable to conceive how any eyes could miss it. The 
thought broke out of him as a cry of bewilderment: "But he knows nothing 
about the steel business!" 

"What has that got to do with it? He needs a job." 

"But he couldn't do the work." 

"He needs to gain self-confidence and to feel important." 
"But he wouldn't be any good whatever." 
"He needs to feel that he's wanted." 
"Here? What could I want him for?" 
"You hire plenty of strangers." 

"I hire men who produce. What has he got to offer?" 
"He's your brother, isn't he?" 
"What has that got to do with it?" 

She stared incredulously, in turn, silenced by shock. For a moment, they 
sat looking at each other, as if across an interplanetary distance. 

"He's your brother," she said, her voice like a phonograph record 
repeating a magic formula she could not permit herself to doubt. "He needs a 
position in the world. He needs a salary, so that he'd feel that he's got 
money coming to him as his due, not as alms." 

"As his due? But he wouldn't be worth a nickel to me." 

"Is that what you think of first? Your profit? I'm asking you to help your 
brother, and you're figuring how to make a nickel on him, and you won't help 
him unless there's money in it for you— is that it?" 

She saw the expression of his eyes, and she looked away, but spoke 
hastily, her voice rising. "Yes, sure, you're helping him— like you'd help any 
stray beggar. Material help— that's all you know or understand. Have you 



thought about his spiritual needs and what his position is doing to his self- 
respect? He doesn't want to live like a beggar. He wants to be independent of 
you . " 

"By means of getting from me a salary he can't earn for work he can't do?" 
"You'd never miss it. You've got enough people here who ' re making money 
for you . " 

"Are you asking me to help him stage a fraud of that kind?" 
"You don't have to put it that way." 
"Is it a fraud-or isn't it?" 

"That's why I can't talk to you— because you're not human. You have no 
pity, no feeling for your brother, no compassion for his feelings." 
"Is it a fraud or not?" 
"You have no mercy for anybody." 

"Do you think that a fraud of this kind would be just?" 

"You're the most immoral man living— you think of nothing but justice! You 
don't feel any love at all!" 

He got up, his movement abrupt and stressed, the movement of ending an 
interview and ordering a visitor out of his office. "Mother, I'm running a 
steel plant— not a whorehouse." 

"Henry!" The gasp of indignation was at his choice of language, nothing 
more . 

"Don't ever speak to me again about a job for Philip. I would not give him 
the job of a cinder sweeper. I would not allow him inside my mills. I want 
you to understand that, once and for all. You may try to help him in any way 
you wish, but don't ever let me see you thinking of my mills as a means to 
that end." 

The wrinkles of her soft chin trickled into a shape resembling a sneer. 
"What are they, your mills— a holy temple of some kind?" 

"Why . . . yes," he said softly, astonished at the thought. 

"Don't you ever think of people and of your moral duties?" 

"I don't know what it is that you choose to call morality. No, I don't 
think of people— except that if I gave a job to Philip, I wouldn't be able to 
face any competent man who needed work and deserved it." 

She got up. Her head was drawn into her shoulders, and the righteous 
bitterness of her voice seemed to push the words upward at his tall, straight 
figure: "That's your cruelty, that's what's mean and selfish about you. If 
you loved your brother, you'd give him a job he didn't deserve, precisely 
because he didn't deserve it— that would be true love and kindness and 
brotherhood. Else what's love for? If a man deserves a job, there's no virtue 
in giving it to him. Virtue is the giving of the undeserved." 

He was looking at her like a child at an unfamiliar nightmare, incredulity 
preventing it from becoming horror. "Mother," he said slowly, "you don't know 
what you're saying. I'm not able ever to despise you enough to believe that 
you mean it" 

The look on her face astonished him more than all the rest: it was a look 
of defeat and yet of an odd, sly, cynical cunning, as if, for a moment, she 
held some worldly wisdom that mocked his innocence. 

The memory of that look remained in his mind, like a warning signal 
telling him that he had glimpsed an issue which he had to understand. 

But he could not grapple with it, he could not force his mind to accept it 
as worthy of thought, he could find no clue except his dim uneasiness and his 
revulsion— and he had no time to give it, he could not think of it now, he was 
facing his next caller seated in front of his desk— he was listening to a man 
who pleaded for his life. 

The man did not state it in such terms, but Rearden knew that that was the 
essence of the case. What the man put into words was only a a for five 
hundred tons of steel. 



He was Mr. Ward, of the Ward Harvester Company of Minnesota. 

It was an unpretentious company with an unblemished reputation, the kind 
of business concern that seldom grows large, but never fails. Mr. 

Ward represented the fourth generation of a family that had owned the 
plant and had given it the conscientious best of such ability as they 
possessed. 

He was a man in his fifties, with a square, stolid face. Looking at him, 
one knew that he would consider it as indecent to let his face show suffering 
as to remove his clothes in public. He spoke in a dry, businesslike manner. 
He explained that he had always dealt, as his father had, with one of the 
small steel companies now taken over by Orren Boyle's Associated Steel. He 
had waited for his last order of steel for a year. He had spent the last 
month struggling to obtain a personal interview with Rearden. 

"I know that your mills are running at capacity, Mr. Rearden," he said, 
"and I know that you are not in a position to take care of new orders, what 
with your biggest, oldest customers having to wait their turn, you being the 
only decent— I mean, reliable— steel manufacturer left in the country. I don't 
know what reason to offer you as to why you should want to make an exception 
in my case. But there was nothing else for me to do, except close the doors 
of my plant for good, and I"— 

there was a slight break in his voice— "I can't quite see my way to closing 
the doors ... as yet . . . so I thought I'd speak to you, even if I didn't 
have much chance . . . still, I had to try everything possible." 

This was language that Rearden could understand, "I wish I could help you 
out, " he said, "but this is the worst possible time for me, because of a very 
large, very special order that has to take precedence over everything." 

"I know. But would you just give me a hearing, Mr. Rearden?" 

"Sure. " 

"If it's a question of money, I'll pay anything you ask. If I could make 
it worth your while that way, why, charge me any extra you please, charge me 
double the regular price, only let me have the steel. 

I wouldn't care if I had to sell the harvester at a loss this year, just 
so I could keep the doors open. I've got enough, personally, to run at a loss 
for a couple of years, if necessary, just to hold out— because, I figure, 
things can't go on this way much longer, conditions are bound to improve, 
they've got to or else we'll—" He did not finish. He said firmly, "They've 
got to." 

"They will," said Rearden. 

The thought of the John Gait Line ran through his mind like a harmony 
under the confident sound of his words. The John Gait Line was moving 
forward. The attacks on his Metal had ceased. He felt as if, miles apart 
across the country, he and Dagny Taggart now stood in empty space, their way 
cleared, free to finish the job. They'll leave us alone to do it, he thought. 
The words were like a battle hymn in his mind: They'll leave us alone. 

"Our plant capacity is one thousand harvesters per year," said Mr. 

Ward. "Last year, we put out three hundred. I scraped the steel together 
from bankruptcy sales, and begging a few tons here and there from big 
companies, and just going around like a scavenger to all sorts of unlikely 
places— well, I won't bore you with that, only I never thought I'd live to see 
the time when I'd have to do business that way. 

And all the while Mr. Orren Boyle was swearing to me that he was going to 
deliver the steel next week. But whatever he managed to pour, it went to new 
customers of his, for some reason nobody would mention, only I heard it 
whispered that they were men with some sort of political pull. And now I 
can't even get to Mr. Boyle at all. 

He's in Washington, been there for over a month. And all his office tells 
me is just that they can't help it, because they can't get the ore." 



"Don't waste your time on them," said Rearden. "You'll never get anything 
from that outfit." 

"You know, Mr. Rearden," he said in the tone of a discovery which he could 
not quite bring himself to believe, "I think there's something phony about 
the way Mr. Boyle runs his business. I can't understand what he's after. 
They've got half their furnaces idle, but last month there were all those big 
stories about Associated Steel in all the newspapers. About their output? 
Why, no— about the wonderful housing project that Mr. Boyle's just built for 
his workers. Last week, it was colored movies that Mr. Boyle sent to all the 
high schools, showing how steel is made and what great service it performs 
for everybody. 

Now Mr. Boyle's got a radio program, they give talks about the importance 
of the steel industry to the country and they keep saying that we must 
preserve the steel industry as a whole. I don't understand what he means by 
it as a whole." 

"I do. Forget it. He won't get away with it." 

"You know, Mr. Rearden, I don't like people who talk too much about how 
everything they do is just for the sake of others. It's not true, and I don't 
think it would be right if it ever were true. So I'll say that what I need 
the steel for is to save my own business. Because it's mine. Because if I had 
to close it ... oh well, nobody understands that nowadays." 

"I do." 

"Yes . . . Yes, I think you would. . . . So, you see, that's my first 
concern. But still, there are my customers, too. They've dealt with me for 
years. They're counting on me. It's just about impossible to get any sort of 
machinery anywhere. Do you know what it's getting to be like, out in 
Minnesota, when the farmers can't get tools, when machine break down in the 
middle of the harvest season and there are no parts, no replacements . . . 
nothing but Mr. Orren Boyle's colored movies about . . . Oh well . . . And 
then there are my workers, too. Some of them have been with us since my 
father's time. They've got no other place to go. Not now." 

It was impossible, thought Rearden, to squeeze more steel out of mills 
where every furnace, every hour and every ton were scheduled in advance for 
urgent orders, for the next six months. But . . . The John Gait Line, he 
thought. If he could do that, he could do anything. 

- . . He felt as if he wished to undertake ten new problems at once. 

He felt as if this were a world where nothing was impossible to him. 

"Look, " he said, reaching for the telephone, "let me check with my 
superintendent and see just what we're pouring in the next few weeks. 

Maybe I'll find a way to borrow a few tons from some of the orders and—" 

Mr. Ward looked quickly away from him, but Rearden had caught a glimpse of 
his face. It's so much for him, thought Rearden, and so little for me! 

He lifted the telephone receiver, but he had to drop it, because the door 
of his office flew open and Gwen Ives rushed in. 

It seemed impossible that Miss Ives should permit herself a breach of that 
kind, or that the calm of her face should look like an unnatural distortion, 
or that her eyes should seem blinded, or that her steps should sound a shred 
of discipline away from staggering. She said, "Excuse me for interrupting, 
Mr. Rearden," but he knew that she did not see the office, did not see Mr. 
Ward, saw nothing but him. "I thought I must tell you that the Legislature 
has just passed the Equalization of Opportunity Bill." 

It was the stolid Mr. Ward who screamed, "Oh God, no! Oh, no!"— 

staring at Rearden. 

Rearden had leaped to his feet. He stood unnaturally bent, one shoulder 
drooping forward. It was only an instant. Then he looked around him, as if 
regaining eyesight, said, "Excuse me, " his glance including both Miss Ives 
and Mr. Ward, and sat down again. 



"We were not informed that the Bill had been brought to the floor, were 
we?" he asked, his voice controlled and dry. 

"No, Mr. Rearden. Apparently, it was a surprise move and it took them just 
forty-five minutes." 

"Have you heard from Mouch?" 

"No, Mr. Rearden." She stressed the no. "It was the office boy from the 
fifth floor who came running in to tell me that he'd just heard it on the 
radio. I called the newspapers to verify it. I tried to reach Mr. 

Mouch in Washington. His office does not answer." 

"When did we hear from him last?" 

"Ten days ago, Mr. Rearden." 

"All right. Thank you, Gwen. Keep trying to get his office." 
"Yes, Mr. Rearden." 

She walked out. Mr. Ward was on his feet, hat in hand. He muttered, "I 
guess I'd better—" 

"Sit down!" Rearden snapped fiercely. 
Mr. Ward obeyed, staring at him. 

"We had business to transact, didn't we?" said Rearden. Mr. Ward could not 
define the emotion that contorted Rearden 's mouth as he spoke. "Mr. Ward, 
what is it that the foulest bastards on earth denounce us for, among other 
things? Oh yes, for our motto of 'Business as usual.' Well— business as usual, 
Mr. Ward!" 

He picked up the telephone receiver and asked for his superintendent. 
"Say, Pete . . . What? . . . Yes, I've heard. Can it. We'll talk about that 
later. What I want to know is, could you let me have five hundred tons of 
steel, extra, above schedule, in the next few weeks? 

. . . Yes, I know ... I know it's tough. . . . Give me the dates and the 
figures." He listened, rapidly jotting notes down on a sheet of paper. Then 
he said, "Right. Thank you," and hung up. 

He studied the figures for a few moments, marking some brief calculations 
on the margin of the sheet. Then he raised his head. 

"All right, Mr. Ward," he said. "You will have your steel in ten days." 

When Mr. Ward had gone, Rearden came out into the anteroom. 

He said to Miss Ives, his voice normal, "Wire Fleming in Colorado. 

He'll know why I have to cancel that option." She inclined her head, in 
the manner of a nod signifying obedience. She did not look at him. 

He turned to his next caller and said, with a gesture of invitation toward 
his office, "How do you do. Come in." 

He would think of it later, he thought; one moves step by step and one 
must keep moving. For the moment, with an unnatural clarity, with a brutal 
simplification that made it almost easy, his consciousness contained nothing 
but one thought: It must not stop me. The sentence hung alone, with no past 
and no future. He did not think of what it was that must not stop him, or why 
this sentence was such a crucial absolute. It held him and he obeyed. He went 
step by step. He completed his schedule of appointments, as scheduled. 

It was late when his last caller departed and he came out of his office. 
The rest of his staff had gone home. Miss Ives sat alone at her desk in an 
empty room. She sat straight and stiff, her hands clasped tightly together in 
her lap. Her head was not lowered, but held rigidly level, and her face 
seemed frozen. Tears were running down her cheeks, with no sound, with no 
facial movement, against her resistance, beyond control. 

She saw him and said dryly, guiltily, in apology, "I'm sorry, Mr. 

Rearden," not attempting the futile pretense of hiding her face. 

He approached her. "Thank you," he said gently. 

She looked up at him, astonished. 

He smiled. "But don't you think you're underestimating me, Gwen? 
Isn't it too soon to cry over me?" 



"I could have taken the rest of it, " she whispered, "but they"— she pointed 
at the newspapers on her desk— "they ' re calling it a victory for anti-greed." 

He laughed aloud. "I can see where such a distortion of the English 
language would make you furious," he said. "But what else?" 

As she looked at him, her mouth relaxed a little. The victim whom she 
could not protect was her only point of reassurance in a world dissolving 
around her. 

He moved his hand gently across her forehead; it was an unusual break of 
formality for him, and a silent acknowledgment of the things at which he had 
not laughed. "Go home, Gwen. I won't need you tonight. I'm going home myself 
in just a little while. No, I don't want you to wait." 

It was past midnight, when, still sitting at his desk, bent over 
blueprints of the bridge for the John Gait Line, he stopped his work 
abruptly, because emotion reached him in a sudden stab, not to be escaped any 
longer, as if a curtain of anesthesia had broken, He slumped down, halfway, 
still holding onto some shred of resistance, and sat, his chest pressed to 
the edge of the desk to stop him, his head hanging down, as if the only 
achievement still possible to him was not to let his head drop down on the 
desk. He sat that way for a few moments, conscious of nothing but pain, a 
screaming pain without content or limit— he sat, not knowing whether it was in 
his mind or his body, reduced to the terrible ugliness of pain that stopped 
thought . 

In a few moments, it was over. He raised his head and sat up straight, 
quietly, leaning back against his chair. Now he saw that in postponing this 
moment for hours, he had not been guilty of evasion: he had not thought of 
it, because there was nothing to think. 

Thought— he told himself quietly— is a weapon one uses in order to act. No 
action was possible. Thought is the tool by which one makes a choice. No 
choice was left to him. Thought sets one's purpose and the way to reach it. 
In the matter of his life being torn piece by piece out of him, he was to 
have no voice, no purpose, no way, no defense. 

He thought of this in astonishment. He saw for the first time that he had 
never known fear because, against any disaster, he had held the omnipotent 
cure of being able to act. No, he thought, not an assurance of victory— who 
can ever have that?— only the chance to act, which is all one needs. Now he 
was contemplating, impersonally and for the first time, the real heart of 
terror: being delivered to destruction with one's hands tied behind one's 
back. 

Well, then, go on with your hands tied, he thought. Go on in chains. 
Go on. It must not stop you. . . . But another voice was telling him 

things he did not want to hear, while he fought back, crying through and 

against it: There's no point in thinking of that . . . there's no use . . . 

what for? . . . leave it alone! 

He could not choke it off. He sat still, over the drawings of the bridge 

for the John Gait Line, and heard the things released by a voice that was 

part-sound, part-sight: They decided it without him. 

. . . They did not call for him, they did not ask, they did not let him 

speak. . . . They were not bound even by the duty to let him know- 
to let him know that they had slashed part of his life away and that he 

had to be ready to walk on as a cripple. ... Of ah" those concerned, 

whoever they were, for whichever reason, for whatever need, he was the one 

they had not had to consider. 

The sign at the end of a long road said: Rearden Ore. It hung over black 

tiers of metal . . . and over years and nights . . . over a clock ticking 

drops of his blood away . . . the blood he had given gladly, exultantly in 

payment for a distant day and a sign over a road . . paid for with his 

effort, his strength, his mind, his hope. 



Destroyed at the whim of some men who sat and voted . . . Who knows by 
what minds? . . . Who knows whose will had placed them in power?— 

what motive moved them?— what was their knowledge?— which one of them, 
unaided, could bring a chunk of ore out of the earth? . . . Destroyed at the 
whim of men whom he had never seen and who had never seen those tiers of 
metal . . . Destroyed, because they so decided. By what right? 

He shook his head. There are things one must not contemplate, he thought. 
There is an obscenity of evil which contaminates the observer. 

There is a limit to what it is proper for a man to see. He must not think 
of this, or look within it, or try to learn the nature of its roots. 

Feeling quiet and empty, he told himself that he would be all right 
tomorrow. He would forgive himself the weakness of this night, it was like 
the tears one is permitted at a funeral, and then one learns how to live with 
an open wound or with a crippled factory. 

He got up and walked to the window. The mills seemed deserted and still; 
he saw feeble snatches of red above black funnels, long coils of steam, the 
webbed diagonals of cranes and bridges. 

He felt a desolate loneliness, of a kind he had never known before. 

He thought that Gwen Ives and Mr. Ward could look to him for hope, for 
relief, for renewal of courage. To whom could he look for it? He, too, needed 
it, for once. He wished he had a friend who could be permitted to see him 
suffer, without pretense or protection, on whom he could lean for a moment, 
just to say, "I'm very tired," and find a moment's rest. Of all the men he 
knew, was there one he wished he had beside him now? He heard the answer in 
his mind, immediate and shocking: Francisco d'Anconia. 

His chuckle of anger brought him back. The absurdity of the longing jolted 
him into calm. That's what you get, he thought, when you indulge yourself in 
weakness . 

He stood at the window, trying not to think. But he kept hearing words in 
his mind: Rearden Ore . . . Rearden Coal . . . Rearden Steel . . . Rearden 
Metal . . . What was the use? Why had he done it? Why should he ever want to 
do anything again? . . . 

His first day on the ledges of the ore mines . . . The day when he stood 
in the wind, looking down at the ruins of a steel plant . . . The day when he 
stood here, in this office, at this window, and thought that a bridge could 
be made to carry incredible loads on just a few bars of metal, if one 
combined a truss with an arch, if one built diagonal bracing with the top 
members curved to— 

He stopped and stood still. He had not thought of combining a truss with 
an arch, that day. 

In the next moment, he was at his desk, bending over it, with one knee on 
the seat of the chair, with no time to think of sitting down, he was drawing 
lines, curves, triangles, columns of calculations, indiscriminately on the 
blueprints, on the desk blotter, on somebody's letters. 

And an hour later, he was calling for a long-distance line, he was waiting 
for a phone to ring by a bed in a railway car on a siding, he was saying, 
"Dagny! That bridge of ours— throw in the ash can all the drawings I sent you, 
because . . . What? . . . Oh, that? To hell with that! Never mind the looters 
and their laws! Forget it! Dagny, what do we care! Listen, you know the 
contraption you called the Rearden Truss, that you admired so much? It's not 
worth a damn. I've figured out a truss that will beat anything ever built! 
Your bridge will carry four trains at once, stand three hundred years and 
cost you less than your cheapest culvert. I'll send you the drawings in two 
days, but I wanted to tell you about it right now. You see, it's a matter of 
combining a truss with an arch. If we take diagonal bracing and . . . 

What? ... I can't hear you. Have you caught a cold? . . . What are you 
thanking me for, as yet? Wait till I explain it to you." 



CHAPTER VIII 
THE JOHN GALT LINE 



The worker smiled, looking at Eddie Willers across the table. 

"I feel like a fugitive," said Eddie Willers. 'I guess you know why I 
haven't been here for months?" He pointed at the underground cafeteria. 

"I'm supposed to be a vice-president now. The Vice-President in Charge of 
Operation. For God's sake, don't take it seriously. I stood it as long as I 
could, and then I had to escape, if only for one evening. . . . The first 
time I came down here for dinner, after my alleged promotion, they all stared 
at me so much, I didn't dare come back. Well, let them stare. 

You don't. I'm glad that it doesn't make any difference to you. . . . 

No, I haven't seen her for two weeks. But I speak to her on the phone 
every day, sometimes twice a day. . . . Yes, I know how she feels: she loves 
it. What is it we hear over the telephone— sound vibrations, isn't it? Well, 
her voice sounds as if it were turning into light vibrations— if you know what 
I mean. She enjoys running that horrible battle single handed and winning. . 
. . Oh yes, she's winning! Do you know why you haven't read anything about 
the John Gait Line in the newspapers for some time? Because it's going so 
well . . . Only . . . that Rearden Metal rail will be the greatest track ever 
built, but what will be the use, if we don't have any engines powerful enough 
to take advantage of it? 

Look at the kind of patched coal-burners we've got left— they can barely 
manage to drag themselves fast enough for old trolley-car rails. . . . 

Still, there's hope. The United Locomotive Works went bankrupt. That's the 
best break we've had in the last few weeks, because their plant has been 
bought by Dwight Sanders. He's a brilliant young engineer who's got the only 
good aircraft plant in the country. He had to sell the aircraft plant to his 
brother, in order to take over United Locomotive. 

That's on account of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill. Sure, it's just 
a setup between them, but can you blame him? Anyway, we'll see Diesels coming 
out of the United Locomotive Works now. Dwight Sanders will start things 
going. . . . Yes, she's counting on him. Why do you ask that? . . . Yes, he's 
crucially important to us right now. We've just signed a contract with him, 
for the first ten Diesel engines he'll build. When I phoned her that the 
contract was signed, she laughed and said, "You see? Is there ever any reason 
to be afraid?' . . . She said that, because she knows— I've never told her, 
but she knows— that I'm afraid. . . . Yes, I am. ... I don't know ... I 
wouldn't be afraid if I knew of what, I could do something about it. But this 
. . . Tell me, don't you really despise me for being Operating Vice- 
President? . . . 

But don't you see that it's vicious? . . . What honor? I don't know what 
it is that I really am: a clown, a ghost, an understudy or just a rotten 
stooge. When I sit in her office, in her chair, at her desk, I feel worse 
than that: I feel like a murderer. . . . Sure, I know that I'm supposed to be 
a stooge for her— and that would be an honor— but . . . 

but I feel as if in some horrible way which I can't quite grasp, I'm a 
stooge for Jim Taggart. Why should it be necessary for her to have a stooge? 
Why does she have to hide? Why did they throw her out of the building? Do you 
know that she had to move out into a dinky hole in the back alley, across 
from our Express and Baggage Entrance? You ought to take a look at it some 
time, that's the office of John Gait, Inc. 

Yet everybody knows that it's she who's still running Taggart 
Transcontinental. Why does she have to hide the magnificent job she's doing? 

Why are they giving her no credit? Why are they robbing her of her 
achievement— with me as the receiver of stolen goods? Why are they doing 



everything in their power to make it impossible for her to succeed, when 
she's all they've got standing between them and destruction? Why are they 
torturing her in return for saving their lives? . . . What's the matter with 
you? Why do you look at me like that? . . . Yes, I guess you understand. . . 
. There's something about it all that I can't define, and it's something 
evil. That's why I'm afraid. ... I don't think one can get away with it. . 
. . You know, it's strange, but I think they know it, too, Jim and his crowd 
and all of them in the building. There's something guilty and sneaky about 
the whole place. Guilty and sneaky and dead. Taggart Transcontinental is now 
like a man who's lost his soul . . . who's betrayed his soul. . . . No, she 
doesn't care. Last time she was in New York, she came in unexpectedly— I was 
in my office, in her office— and suddenly the door opened and there she was. 
She came in, saying, 'Mr. Willers, I'm looking for a job as a station 
operator, would you give me a chance?' I wanted to damn them all, but I had 
to laugh, I was so glad to see her and she was laughing so happily. She had 
come straight from the airport— she wore slacks and a flying jacket— she looked 
wonderful— she ' d got windburned, it looked like a suntan, just as if she'd 
returned from a vacation. She made me remain where I was, in her chair, and 
she sat on the desk and talked about the new bridge of the John Gait Line. . 
. . No. No, I never asked her why she chose that name. ... I don't know 
what it means to her. A sort of challenge, I guess ... I don't know to whom 
. . . Oh, it doesn't matter, it doesn't mean a thing, there isn't any John 
Gait, but I wish she hadn't used it. I don't like it, do you? . . . You do? 
You don't sound very happy saying it." 

The windows of the offices of the John Gait Line faced a dark alley. 

Looking up from her desk, Dagny could not see the sky, only the wall of a 
building rising past her range of vision. It was the side wall of the great 
skyscraper of Taggart Transcontinental. 

Her new headquarters were two rooms on the ground floor of a half 
collapsed structure. The structure still stood, but its upper stories were 
boarded off as unsafe for occupancy. Such tenants as it sheltered were half- 
bankrupt, existing, as it did, on the inertia of the momentum of the past. 

She liked her new place: it saved money. The rooms contained no 
superfluous furniture or people. The furniture had come from junk shops. The 
people were the choice best she could find. On her rare visits to New York, 
she had no time to notice the room where she worked; she noticed only that it 
served its purpose. 

She did not know what made her stop tonight and look at the thin streaks 
of rain on the glass of the window, at the wall of the building across the 
alley . 

It was past midnight. Her small staff had gone. She was due at the airport 
at three A.M., to fly her plane back to Colorado. She had little left to do, 
only a few of Eddie's reports to read. With the sudden break of the tension 
of hurrying, she stopped, unable to go on. The reports seemed to require an 
effort beyond her power. It was too late to go home and sleep, too early to 
go to the airport. She thought: You're tired— and watched her own mood with 
severe, contemptuous detachment, knowing that it would pass. 

She had flown to New York unexpectedly, at a moment's notice, leaping to 
the controls of her plane within twenty minutes after hearing a brief item in 
a news broadcast. The radio voice had said that Dwight Sanders had retired 
from business, suddenly, without reason or explanation. She had hurried to 
New York, hoping to find him and stop him. 

But she had felt, while flying across the continent, that there would be 
no trace of him to find. 

The spring rain hung motionless in the air beyond the window, like a thin 
mist. She sat, looking across at the open cavern of the Express and Baggage 
Entrance of the Taggart Terminal. There were naked lights inside, among the 



steel girders of the ceiling, and a few piles of luggage on the worn concrete 
of the floor. The place looked abandoned and dead. 

She glanced at a jagged crack on the wall of her office. She heard no 
sound. She knew she was alone in the ruins of a building. It seemed as if she 
were alone in the city. She felt an emotion held back for years: a loneliness 
much beyond this moment, beyond the silence of the room and the wet, 
glistening emptiness of the street; the loneliness of a gray wasteland where 
nothing was worth reaching; the loneliness of her childhood. 

She rose and walked to the window. By pressing her face to the pane, she 
could see the whole of the Taggart Building, its lines converging abruptly to 
its distant pinnacle in the sky. She looked up at the dark window of the room 
that had been her office. She felt as if she were in exile, never to return, 
as if she were separated from the building by much more than a sheet of 
glass, a curtain of rain and the span of a few months. 

She stood, in a room of crumbling plaster, pressed to the windowpane, 
looking up at the unattainable form of everything she loved. She did not know 
the nature of her loneliness. The only words that named it were: This is not 
the world I expected. 

Once, when she was sixteen, looking at a long stretch of Taggart track, at 
the rails that converged— like the lines of a skyscraper— to a single point in 
the distance, she had told Eddie Willers that she had always felt as if the 
rails were held in the hand of a man beyond the horizon— no, not her father or 
any of the men in the office— and some day she would meet him. 

She shook her head and turned away from the window. 

She went back to her desk. She tried to reach for the reports. But 
suddenly she was slumped across the desk, her head on her arm. Don't, she 
thought; but she did not move to rise, it made no difference, there was no 
one to see her. 

This was a longing she had never permitted herself to acknowledge. 

She faced it now. She thought: If emotion is one's response to the things 
the world has to offer, if she loved the rails, the building, and more: if 
she loved her love for them— there was still one response, the greatest, that 
she had missed. She thought: To find a feeling that would hold, as their sum, 
as their final expression, the purpose of all the things she loved on earth . 
. . To find a consciousness like her own, who would be the meaning of her 
world, as she would be of his . . . No, not Francisco d'Anconia, not Hank 
Rearden, not any man she had ever met or admired ... A man who existed only 
in her knowledge of her capacity for an emotion she had never felt, but would 
have given her life to experience . . . She twisted herself in a slow, faint 
movement, her breasts pressed to the desk; she felt the longing in her 
muscles, in the nerves of her body. 

Is that what you want? Is it as simple as that?— she thought, but knew that 
it was not simple. There was some unbreakable link between her love for her 
work and the desire of her body; as if one gave her the right to the other, 
the right and the meaning; as if one were the completion of the other— and the 
desire would never be satisfied, except by a being of equal greatness. 

Her face pressed to her arm, she moved her head, shaking it slowly hi 
negation. She would never find it. Her own thought of what life could be 
like, was all she would ever have of the world she had wanted. Only the 
thought of it— and a few rare moments, like a few lights reflected from it on 
her way— to know, to hold, to follow to the end . . . 

She raised her head. 

On the pavement of the alley, outside her window, she saw the shadow of a 
man who stood at the door of her office. 

The door was some steps away; she could not see him, or the street light 
beyond, only his shadow on the stones of the pavement. He stood perfectly 
still . 



He was so close to the door, like a man about to enter, that she waited to 
hear him knock. Instead, she saw the shadow jerk abruptly, as if he were 
jolted backward, then he turned and walked away. There was only the outline 
of his hat brim and shoulders left on the ground, when he stopped. The shadow 
lay still for a moment, wavered, and grew longer again as he came back. 

She felt no fear. She sat at her desk, motionless, watching in blank 
wonder. He stopped at the door, then backed away from it; he stood somewhere 
in the middle of the alley, then paced restlessly and stopped again. His 
shadow swung like an irregular pendulum across the pavement, describing the 
course of a soundless battle: it was a man fighting himself to enter that 
door or to escape. 

She looked on, with peculiar detachment. She had no power to react, only 
to observe. She wondered numbly, distantly: Who was he? Had he been watching 
her from somewhere in the darkness? Had he seen her slumped across her desk, 
in the lighted, naked window? Had he watched her desolate loneliness as she 
was now watching his? She felt nothing. 

They were alone in the silence of a dead city— it seemed to her that he was 
miles away, a reflection of suffering without identity, a fellow survivor 
whose problem was as distant to her as hers would be to him. 

He paced, moving out of her sight, coming back again. She sat, watching— on 
the glistening pavement of a dark alley— the shadow of an unknown torment. 

The shadow moved away once more. She waited. It did not return. 

Then she leaped to her feet. She had wanted to see the outcome of the 
battle; now that he had won it— or lost— she was struck by the sudden, urgent 
need to know his identity and motive. She ran through the dark anteroom, she 
threw the door open and looked out. 

The alley was empty. The pavement went tapering off into the distance, 
like a band of wet mirror under a few spaced lights. There was no one in 
sight. She saw the dark hole of a broken window in an abandoned shop. Beyond 
it, there were the doors of a few rooming houses. Across the alley, streaks 
of rain glittered under a light that hung over the black gap of an open door 
leading down to the underground tunnels of Taggart Transcontinental.

Rearden signed the papers, pushed them across the desk and looked away, 
thinking that he would never have to think of them again, wishing he were 
carried to the time when this moment would be far behind him. 

Paul Larkin reached for the papers hesitantly; he looked ingratiatingly 
helpless, "It's only a legal technicality, Hank," he said. "You know that 
I'll always consider these ore mines as yours." 

Rearden shook his head slowly; it was just a movement of his neck muscles; 
his face looked immovable, as if he were speaking to a stranger. 

"No!" he said. "Either I own a property or I don't." 

"But . . . but you know that you can trust me. You don't have to worry 
about your supply of ore. We've made an agreement. You know that you can 
count on me . " 

"I don't know it. I hope I can." 

"But I've given you my word." 

"I have never been at the mercy of anyone's word before." 

"Why . . . why do you say that? We're friends. I'll do anything you wish. 
You'll get my entire output. The mines are still yours— just as good as yours. 
You have nothing to fear. I'll . . . Hank, what's the matter?" 

"Don't talk." 

"But . . . but what's the matter?" 

"I don't like assurances. I don't want any pretense about how safe I am. 
I'm not. We have made an agreement which I can't enforce. I want you to know 



that I understand my position fully. If you intend to keep your word, don't 
talk about it, just do it." 

"Why do you look at me as if it were my fault? You know how badly I feel 
about it. I bought the mines only because I thought it would help you out— I 
mean, I thought you'd rather sell them to a friend than to some total 
stranger. It's not my fault. I don't like that miserable Equalization Bill, I 
don't know who's behind it, I never dreamed they'd pass it, it was such a 
shock to me when they—" 

"Never mind . " 

"But I only-" 

"Why do you insist on talking about it?" 

"I . . ." Larkin's voice was pleading. "I gave you the best price, Hank. 
The law said 'reasonable compensation.' My bid was higher than anyone 
else ' s . " 

Rearden looked at the papers still lying across the desk. He thought of 
the payment these papers gave him for his ore mines. Two-thirds of the sum 
was money which Larkin had obtained as a loan from the government; the new 
law made provisions for such loans "in order to give a fair opportunity to 
the new owners who have never had a chance." 

Two-thirds of the rest was a loan he himself had granted to Larkin, a 
mortgage he had accepted on his own mines. . . . And the government money, he 
thought suddenly, the money now given to him as payment for his property, 
where had that come from? Whose work had provided it? 

"'You don't have to worry, Hank," said Larkin, with that incomprehensible, 
insistent note of pleading in his voice. "It's just a paper formality." 

Rearden wondered dimly what it was that Larkin wanted from him. 

He felt that the man was waiting for something beyond the physical fact of 
the sale, some words which he, Rearden, was supposed to pronounce, some 
action pertaining to mercy which he was expected to grant. Larkin's eyes, in 
this moment of his best fortune, had the sickening look of a beggar. 

"Why should you be angry, Hank? It's only a new form of legal red tape. 
Just a new historical condition. Nobody can help it, if it's, a historical 
condition. Nobody can be blamed for it. But there's always a way to get 
along. Look at all the others. They don't mind. They're—" 

"They're setting up stooges whom they control, to run the properties 
extorted from them. I—" 

"Now why do you want to use such words?" 

"I might as well tell you— and I think you know it— that I am not good at 
games of that kind. I have neither the time nor the stomach to devise some 
form of blackmail in order to tie you up and own my mines through you. 
Ownership is a thing I don't share. And I don't wish to hold it by the grace 
of your cowardice— by means of a constant struggle to outwit you and keep some 
threat over your head. I don't do business that way and I don't deal with 
cowards. The mines are yours. If you wish to give me first call on all the 
ore produced, you will do so. 

If you wish to double-cross me, it's in your power." 

Larkin looked hurt. "That's very unfair of you," he said; there was a dry 
little note of righteous reproach in his voice. "I have never given you cause 
to distrust me." He picked up the papers with a hasty movement. 

Rearden saw the papers disappear into Larkin's inside coat pocket. 

He saw the flare of the open coat, the wrinkles of a vest pulled tight 
over flabby bulges, and a stain of perspiration in the armpit of the shirt. 

Unsummoned, the picture of a face seen twenty-seven years ago rose 
suddenly in his mind. It was the face of a preacher on a street corner he had 
passed, in a town he could not remember any longer. Only the dark walls of 
the slums remained in his memory, the rain of an autumn evening, and the 
righteous malice of the man's mouth, a small mouth stretched to yell into the 



darkness: ". . . the noblest ideal— that man live for the sake of his 
brothers, that the strong work for the weak, that he who has ability serve 
him who hasn't . . . " 

Then he saw the boy who had been Hank Rearden at eighteen. He saw the 
tension of the face, the speed of the walk, the drunken exhilaration of the 
body, drunk on the energy of sleepless nights, the proud lift of the head, 
the clear, steady, ruthless eyes, the eyes of a man who drove himself without 
pity toward that which he wanted. And he saw what Paul Larkin must have been 
at that time— a youth with an aged baby's face, smiling ingratiatingly, 
joylessly, begging to be spared, pleading with the universe to give him a 
chance. If someone had shown that youth to the Hank Rearden of that time and 
told him that this was to be the goal of his steps, the collector of the 
energy of his aching tendons, what would he have- 
It was not a thought, it was like the punch of a fist inside his skull. 
Then, when he could think again, Rearden knew what the boy he had been 
would have felt: a desire to step on the obscene thing which was Larkin and 
grind every wet bit of it out of existence. 

He had never experienced an emotion o[ this kind. It took him a few 
moments to realize that this was what men called hatred. 

He noticed that rising to leave and muttering some sort of good-byes, 
Larkin had a wounded, reproachful, mouth-pinched look, as if he, Larkin, were 
the injured party. 

When he sold his coal mines to Ken Danagger, who owned the largest coal 
company in Pennsylvania, Rearden wondered why he felt as if it were almost 
painless. He felt no hatred. Ken Danagger was a man in his fifties, with a 
hard, closed face; he had started in life as a miner. 

When Rearden handed to him the deed to his new property, Danagger said 
impassively, "I don't believe I've mentioned that any coal you buy from me, 
you'll get it at cost." 

Rearden glanced at him, astonished. "It's against the law," he said. 

"Who's going to find out what sort of cash I band to you in your own 
living room?" 

"You're talking about a rebate." 

"I am." 

"That's against two dozen laws. They'll sock you worse than me, if they 
catch you at it." 

"Sure. That's your protection— so you won't be left at the mercy of my good 
will." 

Rearden smiled; it was a happy smile, but he closed his eyes as under a 
blow. Then he shook his head. "Thanks," he said. "But I'm not one of them. I 
don't expect anybody to work for me at cost." 

"I'm not one of them, either," said Danagger angrily. "Look here, Rearden, 
don't you suppose I know what I'm getting, unearned? The money doesn't pay 
you for it. Not nowadays." 

"You didn't volunteer to bid to buy my property. I asked you to buy it. I 
wish there had been somebody like you in the ore business, to take over my 
mines. There wasn't. If you want to do me a favor, don't offer me rebates. 
Give me a chance to pay you higher prices, higher than anyone else will 
offer, sock me anything you wish, just so I'll be first to get the coal. I'll 
manage my end of it. Only let me have the coal." 

"You'll have it." 

Rearden wondered, for a while, why he heard no word from Wesley Mouch. His 
calls to Washington remained unanswered. Then he received a letter consisting 
of a single sentence which informed him that Mr. Mouch was resigning from his 
employ. Two weeks later, he read in the newspapers that Wesley Mouch had been 
appointed Assistant Coordinator of the Bureau of Economic Planning and 
National Resources. 



Don't dwell on any of it— thought Rearden, through the silence of many 
evenings, fighting the sudden access of that new emotion which he did not 
want to feel— there is an unspeakable evil in the world, you know it, and it's 
no use dwelling on the details of it. You must work a little harder. Just a 
little harder. Don't let it win. 

The beams and girders of the Rearden Metal bridge were coming daily out of 
the rolling mills, and were being shipped to the site of the John Gait Line, 
where the first shapes of green-blue metal, swung into space to span the 
canyon, glittered in the first rays of the spring sun. 

He had no time for pain, no energy for anger. Within a few weeks, it was 
over; the blinding stabs of hatred ceased and did not return. 

He was back in confident self-control on the evening when he telephoned 
Eddie Willers, "Eddie, I'm in New York, at the Wayne-Falkland. Come to have 
breakfast with me tomorrow morning. There's something I'd like to discuss 
with you." 

Eddie Willers went to the appointment with a heavy feeling of guilt. 

He had not recovered from the shock of the Equalization of Opportunity 
Bill; it had left a dull ache within him, like the black-and-blue mark of a 
blow. He disliked the sight of the city: it now looked as if it hid the 
threat of some malicious unknown. He dreaded facing one of the Bill's 
victims: he felt almost as if he, Eddie Willers, shared the responsibility 
for it in some terrible way which he could not define. 

When he saw Rearden, the feeling vanished. There was no hint suggesting a 
victim, in Rearden 's bearing. Beyond the windows of the hotel room, the 
spring sunlight of early morning sparkled on the windows of the city, the sky 
was a very pale blue that seemed young, the offices were still closed, and 
the city did not look as if it held malice, but as if it were joyously, 
hopefully ready to swing into action— in the same manner as Rearden. He looked 
refreshed by an untroubled sleep, he wore a dressing gown, he seemed 
impatient of the necessity to dress, unwilling to delay the exciting game of 
his business duties. 

"Good morning, Eddie. Sorry if I got you out so early. It's the only time 
I had. Have to go back to Philadelphia right after breakfast. We can talk 
while we're eating." 

The dressing gown he wore was of dark blue flannel, with the white 
initials "H R" on the breast pocket. He looked young, relaxed, at home in 
this room and in the world. 

Eddie watched a waiter wheel the breakfast table into the room with a 
swift efficiency that made him feel braced. He found himself enjoying the 
stiff freshness of the white tablecloth and the sunlight sparkling on the 
silver, on the two bowls of crushed ice holding glasses of orange juice; he 
had not known that such things could give him an invigorating pleasure. 

"I didn't want to phone Dagny long distance about this particular matter," 
said Rearden. "She has enough to do. We can settle it in a few minutes, you 
and I." 

"If I have the authority to do it," 

Rearden smiled. "You have." He leaned forward across the table. 
"Eddie, what's the financial state of Taggart Transcontinental at the 
moment? Desperate?" 

"Worse than that, Mr. Rearden." 
"Are you able to meet pay rolls?" 

"Not quite. We've kept it out of the newspapers, but I think everybody 
knows it. We're in arrears all over the system and Jim is running out of 
excuses . " 

"Do you know that your first payment for the Rearden Metal rail is due 
next week?" 

"Yes, I know it." 



"Well, let's agree on a moratorium. I'm going to give you an extension— you 
won't have to pay me anything until six months after the opening of the John 
Gait Line." 

Eddie Willers put down his cup of coffee with a sharp thud. He could not 
say a word. 

Rearden chuckled. "What's the matter? You do have the authority to accept, 
don't you?" 

"Mr. Rearden ... I don't know . . . what to say to you." 

"Why, just 'okay' is all that's necessary," 

"Okay, Mr. Rearden." Eddie's voice was barely audible. 

"I'll draw up the papers and send them to you. You can tell Jim about it 
and have him sign them." 
"Yes, Mr. Rearden." 

"I don't like to deal with Jim. He'd waste two hours trying to make 
himself believe that he's made me believe that he's doing me a favor by 
accepting . " 

Eddie sat without moving, looking down at his plate. 
"What's the matter?" 

"Mr. Rearden, I'd like ... to say thank you . . . but there isn't any 
form of it big enough to—" 

"Look, Eddie. You've got the makings of a good businessman, so you'd 
better get a few things straight. There aren't any thank-you's in situations 
of this kind. I'm not doing it for Taggart Transcontinental. 

It's a simple, practical, selfish matter on my part. Why should I collect 
my money from you now, when it might prove to be the death blow to your 
company? If your company were no good, I'd collect, and fast. I don't engage 
in charity and I don't gamble on incompetents. But you're still the best 
railroad in the country. When the John Gait Line is completed, you'll be the 
soundest one financially. So I have good reason to wait. Besides, you're in 
trouble on account of my rail. I intend to see you win," 

"I still owe you thanks, Mr. Rearden . . . for something much greater than 
charity . " 

"No. Don't you see? I have just received a great deal of money . . . 
which I didn't want. I can't invest it. It's of no use to me whatever. . . 

So, in a way, it pleases me that I can turn that money against the same 
people in the same battle. They made it possible for me to give you an 
extension to help you fight them." 

He saw Eddie wincing, as if he had hit a wound. "That's what's horrible 
about it!" 

"What?" 

"What they've done to you— and what you're doing in return. I mean—" He 
stopped. "Forgive me, Mr. Rearden. I know this is no way to talk business." 

Rearden smiled. "Thanks, Eddie. I know what you mean. But forget it. To 
hell with them." 

"Yes. Only . . .Mr. Rearden, may I say something to you? I know it's 
completely improper and I'm not speaking as a vice-president." 
"Go ahead." 

"I don't have to tell you what your offer means to Dagny, to me, to every 
decent person on Taggart Transcontinental. You know it. And you know you can 
count on us. But . . . but I think it's horrible that Jim Taggart should 
benefit, too— that you should be the one to save him and people like him, 
after they—" 

Rearden laughed. "Eddie, what do we care about people like him? 

We're driving an express, and they're riding on the roof, making a lot of 
noise about being leaders. Why should we care? We have enough power to carry 
them along— haven ' t we?" 



"It won ' t stand. " 

The summer sun made blotches of fire on the windows of the city, and 
glittering sparks in the dust of the streets. Columns of heat shimmered 
through the air, rising from the roofs to the white page of the calendar. The 
calendar's motor ran on, marking off the last days of June. 

"It won't stand," people said. "When they run the first train on the John 
Gait Line, the rail will split. They'll never get to the bridge. If they do, 
the bridge will collapse under the engine." 

From the slopes of Colorado, freight trains rolled down the track of the 
Phoenix-Durango, north to Wyoming and the main line of Taggart 
Transcontinental, south to New Mexico and the main line of the Atlantic 
Southern. Strings of tank cars went radiating in all directions from the 
Wyatt oil fields to industries in distant states. No one spoke about them. To 
the knowledge of the public, the tank trains moved as silently as rays and, 
as rays, they were noticed only when they became the light of electric lamps, 
the heat of furnaces, the movement of motors; but as such, they were not 
noticed, they were taken for granted. 

The Phoenix-Durango Railroad was to end operations on July 25. 

"Hank Rearden is a greedy monster," people said. "Look at the fortune he's 
made. Has he ever given anything in return? Has he ever shown any sign of 
social conscience? Money, that's all he's after. He'll do anything for money. 
What does he care if people lose their lives when his bridge collapses?" 

"The Taggarts have been a band of vultures for generations, " people said. 
"It's in their blood. Just remember that the founder of that family was Nat 
Taggart, the most notoriously anti-social scoundrel that ever lived, who bled 
the country white to squeeze a fortune for himself. You can be sure that a 
Taggart won't hesitate to risk people's lives in order to make a profit. They 
bought inferior rail, because it's cheaper than steel— what do they care about 
catastrophes and mangled human bodies, after they've collected the fares?" 

People said it because other people said it. They did not know why it was 
being said and heard everywhere. They did not give or ask for reasons. 
"Reason," Dr. Pritchett had told them, "is the most naive of all 
superstitions . " 

"The source of public opinion?" said Claude Slagenhop in a radio speech. 
'There is no source of public opinion. It is spontaneously general. It is a 
reflex of the collective instinct of the collective mind." 

Orren Boyle gave an interview to Globe, the news magazine with the largest 
circulation. The interview was devoted to the subject of the grave social 
responsibility of metallurgists, stressing the fact that metal performed so 
many crucial tasks where human lives depended on its quality. "One should 
not, it seems to me, use human beings as guinea pigs in the launching of a 
new product," he said. He mentioned no names. 

"Why, no, I don't say that that bridge will collapse," said the chief 
metallurgist of Associated Steel, on a television program. "I don't say it at 
all. I just say that if I had any children, I wouldn't let them ride on the 
first train that's going to cross that bridge. But it's only a personal 
preference, nothing more, just because I'm overly fond of children." 

"I don't claim that the Rearden-Taggart contraption will collapse," 

wrote Bertram Scudder in The Future. "Maybe it will and maybe it won't. 
That's not the important issue. The important issue is: what protection does 
society have against the arrogance, selfishness and greed of two unbridled 
individualists, whose records are conspicuously devoid of any public-spirited 
actions? These two, apparently, are willing to stake the lives of their 
fellow men on their own conceited notions about their powers of judgment, 
against the overwhelming majority opinion of recognized experts. Should 
society permit it? If that thing does collapse, won't it be too late to take 
precautionary measures? Won't it be like locking the barn after the horse has 



escaped? It has always been the belief of this column that certain kinds of 
horses should be kept bridled and locked, on general social principles." 

A group that called itself "Committee of Disinterested Citizens" collected 
signatures on a petition demanding a year's study of the John Gait Line by 
government experts before the first train were allowed to run. The petition 
stated that its signers had no motive other than "a sense of civic duty." The 
first signatures were those of Balph Eubank and Mort Liddy. The petition was 
given a great deal of space and comment in all the newspapers. The 
consideration it received was respectful, because it came from people who 
were disinterested. 

No space was given by the newspapers to the progress of the construction 
of the John Gait Line. No reporter was sent to look at the scene. The general 
policy of the press had been stated by a famous editor five years ago. "There 
are no objective facts," he had said. "Every report on facts is only 
somebody's opinion. It is, therefore, useless to write about facts." 

A few businessmen thought that one should think about the possibility that 
there might be commercial value in Rearden Metal. They undertook a survey of 
the question. They did not hire metallurgists to examine samples, nor 
engineers to visit the site of construction. They took a public poll. Ten 
thousand people, guaranteed to represent every existing kin ! 

of brain, were asked the question: "Would you ride on the John Gait Line?" 
The answer, overwhelmingly., was: "No, sir-reel" 

No voices were heard in public in defense of Rearden Metal. And nobody 
attached significance to the fact that the stock of Taggart Transcontinental 
was rising on the market, very slowly, almost furtively. 

There were men who watched and played safe. Mr. Mowen bought Taggart stock 
in the name of his sister. Ben Nealy bought it in the name of a cousin. Paul 
Larkin bought it under an alias. "I don't believe in raising controversial 
issues," said one of these men. 

"Oh yes, of course, the construction is moving on schedule," said James 
Taggart, shrugging, to his Board of Directors. "Oh yes, you may feel full 
confidence. My dear sister does not happen to be a human being, but just an 
internal combustion engine, so one must not wonder at her success." 

When James Taggart heard a rumor that some bridge girders had split and 
crashed, killing three workmen, he leaped to his feet and ran to his 
secretary's office, ordering him to call Colorado. He waited, pressed against 
the secretary's desk, as if seeking protection; his eyes had the unfocused 
look of panic. Yet his mouth moved suddenly into almost a smile and he said, 
"I'd give anything to see Henry Rearden' s face right now." When he heard that 
the rumor was false, he said, "Thank God!" 

But his voice had a note of disappointment. 

"Oh well!" said Philip Rearden to his friends, hearing the same rumor. 
"Maybe he can fail, too, once in a while. Maybe my great brother isn't as 
great as he thinks . " 

"Darling," said Lillian Rearden to her husband, "I fought for you 
yesterday, at a tea where the women were saying that Dagny Taggart is your 
mistress. . . . Oh, for heaven's sake, don't look at me like that! 

I know it's preposterous and I gave them hell for it. It's just that those 
silly bitches can't imagine any other reason why a woman would take such a 
stand against everybody for the sake of your Metal. Of course, I know better 
than that. I know that the Taggart woman is perfectly sexless and doesn't 
give a damn about you— and, darling, I know that if you ever had the courage 
for anything of the sort, which you haven't, you wouldn't go for an adding 
machine in tailored suits, you'd go for some blond, feminine chorus girl who— 
oh, but Henry, I'm only joking! 

—don't look at me like that!" 



"Dagny, " James Taggart said miserably, "what's going to happen to us? 
Taggart Transcontinental has become so unpopular!" 

Dagny laughed, in enjoyment of the moment, any moment, as if the 
undercurrent of enjoyment was constant within her and little was needed to 
tap it. She laughed easily, her mouth relaxed and open. Her teeth were very 
white against her sun-scorched face. Her eyes had the look, acquired in open 
country, of being set for great distances. On her last few visits to New 
York, he had noticed that she looked at him as if she did not see him. 

"What are we going to do? The public is so overwhelmingly against us!" 

"Jim, do you remember the story they tell about Nat Taggart? He said that 
he envied only one of his competitors, the one who said The public be 
damned! ' He wished he had said it." 

In the summer days and in the heavy stillness of the evenings of the city, 
there were moments when a lonely man or woman— on a park bench, on a street 
corner, at an open window— would see in a newspaper a brief mention of the 
progress of the John Gait Line, and would look at the city with a sudden stab 
of hope. They were the very young, who felt that it was the kind of event 
they longed to see happening in the world— or the very old, who had seen a 
world in which such events did happen. They did not care about railroads, 
they knew nothing about business, they knew only that someone was fighting 
against great odds and winning. They did not admire the fighters' purpose, 
they believed the voices of public opinion— and yet, when they read that the 
Line was growing, they felt a moment's sparkle and wondered why it made their 
own problems seem easier. 

Silently, unknown to everyone except to the freight yard of Taggart 
Transcontinental in Cheyenne and the office of the John Gait Line in the dark 
alley, freight was rolling in and orders for cars were piling up— 

for the first train to run on the John Gait Line. Dagny Taggart had 
announced that the first train would be, not a passenger express loaded with 
celebrities and politicians, as was the custom, but a freight special. 

The freight came from farms, from lumber yards, from mines all over the 
country, from distant places whose last means of survival were the new 
factories of Colorado. No one wrote about these shippers, because they were 
men who were not disinterested. 

The Phoenix-Durango Railroad was to close on July 25. The first train of 
the John Gait Line was to run on July 22. 

"Well, it's like this, Miss Taggart," said the delegate of the Union of 
Locomotive Engineers. "I don't think we're going to allow you to run that 
train . " 

Dagny sat at her battered desk, against the blotched wall of her office. 
She said, without moving, "Get out of here." 

It was a sentence the man had never heard in the polished offices of 
railroad executives. He looked bewildered. "I came to tell you—" 
"If you have anything to say to me, start over again." 
"What?" 

"Don't tell me what you're going to allow me to do." 

"Well, I meant we're not going to allow our men to run your train." 

"That's different." 

"Well, that's what we've decided." 

"Who's decided it?" 

"The committee. What you're doing is a violation of human rights. 

You can't force men to go out to get killed— when that bridge collapses — 
just to make money for you." 

She reached for a sheet of blank paper and handed it to him. "Put it down 
in writing," she said, "and we'll sign a contract to that effect." 

"What contract?" 



"That no member of your union will ever be employed to run an engine on 
the John Gait Line." 

"Why . . . wait a minute ... I haven't said—" 
"You don't want to sign such a contract?" 
-No, I-" 

"Why not, since you know that the bridge is going to collapse?" 
"I only want—" 

"I know what you want. You want a stranglehold on your men by means of the 
jobs which I give them— and on me, by means of your men. You want me to 
provide the jobs, and you want to make it impossible for me to have any jobs 
to provide. Now I'll give you a choice. 

That train is going to be run. You have no choice about that. But you can 
choose whether it's going to be run by one of your men or not. If you choose 
not to let them, the train will still run, if I have to drive the engine 
myself. Then, if the bridge collapses, there won't be any railroad left in 
existence, anyway. But if it doesn't collapse, no member of your union will 
ever get a job on the John Gait Line. If you think that I need your men more 
than they need me, choose accordingly. If you know that I can run an engine, 
but they can't build a railroad, choose according to that. Now are you going 
to forbid your men to run that train?" 

"I didn't say we'd forbid it. I haven't said anything about forbidding. 

But . . . but you can't force men to risk their lives on something 
nobody's ever tried before." 

"I'm not going to force anyone to take that run." 

"What are you going to do?" 

"I'm going to ask for a volunteer." 

"And if none of them volunteers?" 

"Then it will be my problem, not yours." 

"Well, let me tell you that I'm going to advise them to refuse." 

"Go ahead. Advise them anything you wish. Tell them whatever, you like. 
But leave the choice to them. Don't try to forbid it." 

The notice that appeared in every roundhouse of the Taggart system was 
signed "Edwin Willers, Vice-President in Charge of Operation." It asked 
engineers, who were willing to drive the first train on the John Gait Line, 
so to inform the office of Mr. Willers., not later than eleven A.M. of July 
15. 

It was a quarter of eleven, on the morning of the fifteenth, when the 
telephone rang in her office. It was Eddie, calling from high up in the 
Taggart Building outside her window. "Dagny, I think you'd better come over." 
His voice sounded queer. 

She hurried across the street, then down the marble-floored halls, to the 
door that still carried the name "Dagny Taggart" on its glass panel. 

She pulled the door open. 

The anteroom of the office was full. Men stood jammed among the desks, 
against the walls. As she entered, they took their hats off in sudden 
silence. She saw the graying heads, the muscular shoulders, she saw the 
smiling faces of her staff at their desks and the face of Eddie Willers at 
the end of the room. Everybody knew that nothing had to be said. 

Eddie stood by the open door of her office. The crowd parted to let her 
approach him. He moved his hand, pointing at the room, then at a pile of 
letters and telegrams. 

"Dagny, every one of them," he said. "Every engineer on Taggart 
Transcontinental. Those who could, came here, some from as far as the Chicago 
Division." He pointed at the mail. "There's the rest of them. 

To be exact, there's only three I haven't heard from: one's on a vacation 
in the north woods, one's in a hospital, and one's in jail for reckless 
driving— of his automobile." 



She looked at the men. She saw the suppressed grins on the solemn faces. 
She inclined her head, in acknowledgment. She stood for a moment, head bowed, 
as if she were accepting a verdict, knowing that the verdict applied to her, 
to every man in the room and to the world beyond the walls of the building. 

"Thank you," she said. 

Most of the men had seen her many times. Looking at her, as she raised her 
head, many of them thought— in astonishment and for the first time— that the 
face of their Operating Vice-President was the face of a woman and that it 
was beautiful. 

Someone in the back of the crowd cried suddenly, cheerfully, 'To hell with 
Jim Taggart ! " 

An explosion answered him. The men laughed, they cheered, they broke into 
applause. The response was out of all proportion to the sentence. But the 
sentence had given them the excuse they needed. They seemed to be applauding 
the speaker, in insolent defiance of authority. 

But everyone in the room knew who it was that they were cheering. 

She raised her hand. "We're too early," she said, laughing. "Wait till a 
week from today. That's when we ought to celebrate. And believe me, we will!" 

They drew lots for the run. She picked a folded slip of paper from among a 
pile containing all their names. The winner was not in the room, but he was 
one of the best men on the system, Pat Logan, engineer of the Taggart Comet 
on the Nebraska Division. 

"Wire Pat and tell him he's been demoted to a freight," she said to Eddie. 
She added casually, as if it were a last-moment decision, but it fooled no 
one, "Oh yes, tell him that I'm going to ride with him in the cab of the 
engine on that run." 

An old engineer beside her grinned and said, "I thought you would, Miss 
Taggart . " 

Rearden was in New York on the day when Dagny telephoned him from her 
office. "Hank, I'm going to have a press conference tomorrow." 
He laughed aloud. "No!" 

"Yes." Her voice sounded earnest, but, dangerously, a bit too earnest. 
"The newspapers have suddenly discovered me and are asking questions. 
I'm going to answer them." 
"Have a good time." 

"I will. Are you going to be in town tomorrow? I'd like to have you in on 
it. " 

"Okay. I wouldn't want to miss it." 

The reporters who came to the press conference in the office of the John 
Gait Line were young men who had been trained to think that their job 
consisted of concealing from the world the nature of its events. It was their 
daily duty to serve as audience for some public- figure who made utterances 
about the public good, in phrases carefully chosen to convey no meaning. It 
was their daily job to sling words together in any combination they pleased, 
so long as the words did not fall into a sequence saying something specific. 
They could not understand the interview now being given to them. 

Dagny Taggart sat behind her desk in an office that looked like a slum 
basement. She wore a dark blue suit with a white blouse, beautifully 
tailored, suggesting an air of formal, almost military elegance. She sat 
straight, and her manner was severely dignified, just a shade too dignified. 

Rearden sat in a corner of the room, sprawled across a broken armchair, 
his long legs thrown over one of its arms, his body leaning against the 
other. His manner was pleasantly informal, just a bit too informal. 

In the clear, monotonous voice of a military report, consulting no papers, 
looking straight at the men, Dagny recited the technological facts about the 
John Gait Line, giving exact figures on the nature of the rail, the capacity 
of the bridge, the method of construction, the costs. Then, in the dry tone 



of a banker, she explained the financial prospects of the Line and named the 
large profits she expected to make. 'That is all," 
she said. 

"All?" said one of the reporters. "Aren't you going to give us a message 
for the public?" 

"That was my message." 

"But hell— I mean, aren't you going to defend yourself?" 
"Against what?" 

"Don't you want to tell us something to justify your Line?" 
"I have." 

A man with a mouth shaped as a permanent sneer asked, "Well, what I want 
to know, as Bertram Scudder stated, is what protection do we have against 
your Line being no good?" 

"Don't ride on it." 

Another asked, "Aren't you going to tell us your motive for building that 
Line?" 

"I have told you: the profit which I expect to make." 

"Oh, Miss Taggart, don't say that!" cried a young boy. He was new, he was 
still honest about his job, and he felt that he liked Dagny Taggart, without 
knowing why. "That's the wrong thing to say. That's what they're all saying 
about you." 

"Are they?" 

"I'm sure you didn't mean it the way it sounds and . . . and I'm sure 
you'll want to clarify it." 

"Why, yes, if you wish me to. The average profit of railroads has been two 
per cent of the capital invested. An industry that does so much and keeps so 
little, should consider itself immoral. As I have explained, the cost of the 
John Gait Line in relation to the traffic which it will carry makes me expect 
a profit of not less than fifteen per cent on our investment. Of course, any 
industrial profit above four per cent is considered usury nowadays. I shall, 
nevertheless, do my best to make the John Gait Line earn a profit of twenty 
per cent for me, if possible. That was my motive for building the Line. Have 
I made myself clear now?" 

The boy was looking at her helplessly. "You don't mean, to earn a profit 
for you, Miss Taggart? You mean, for the small stockholders, of course?" he 
prompted hopefully. 

"Why, no. I happen to be one of the largest stockholders of Taggart 
Transcontinental, so my share of the profits will be one of the largest, Now, 
Mr. Rearden is in a much more fortunate position, because he has no 
stockholders to share with— or would you rather make your own statement, Mr. 
Rearden? " 

"Yes, gladly," said Rearden. "Inasmuch as the formula of Rearden Metal is 
my own personal secret, and in view of the fact that the Metal costs much 
less to produce than you boys can imagine, I expect to skin the public to the 
tune of a profit of twenty-five per cent in the next few years." 

"What do you mean, skin the public, Mr. Rearden?" asked the boy. 

"If it's true, as I've read in your ads, that your Metal will last three 
times longer than any other and at half the price, wouldn't the public be 
getting a bargain?" 

"Oh, have you noticed that?" said Rearden. 

"Do the two of you realize you're talking for publication?" asked the man 
with the sneer. 

"But, Mr. Hopkins," said Dagny, in polite astonishment, "is there any 
reason why we would talk to you, if it weren't for publication?" 
"Do you want us to quote all the things you said?" 

"I hope I may trust you to be sure and quote them. Would you oblige me by 
taking this down verbatim?" She paused to see their pencils ready, then 



dictated: "Miss Taggart says— quote— I expect to make a pile of money on the 
John Gait Line. I will have earned it. Close quote. Thank you so much." 

"Any questions, gentlemen?" asked Rearden. 

There were no questions. 

"Now I must tell you about the opening of the John Gait Line," said Dagny. 
"The first train will depart from the station of Taggart Transcontinental in 
Cheyenne, Wyoming, at four P.M. on July twenty-second. 

It will be a freight special, consisting of eighty cars. It will be driven 
by an eight-thousand-horsepower, four-unit Diesel locomotive— which I'm 
leasing from Taggart Transcontinental for the occasion. It will run non-stop 
to Wyatt Junction, Colorado, traveling at an average speed of one hundred 
miles per hour. I beg your pardon?" she asked, hearing the long, low sound of 
a whistle. 

"What did you say, Miss Taggart?" 

"I said, one hundred miles per hour— grades, curves and all." 

"But shouldn't you cut the speed below normal rather than . . . Miss 
Taggart, don't you have any consideration whatever for public opinion?" 

"But I do . If it weren't for public opinion, an average speed of sixty- 
five miles per hour would have been quite sufficient." 

"Who's going to run that train?" 

"I had quite a bit of trouble about that. All the Taggart engineers 
volunteered to do it. So did the firemen, the brakemen and the conductors. We 
had to draw lots for every job on the train's crew. The engineer will be Pat 
Logan, of the Taggart Comet, the fireman— Ray McKim. 

I shall ride in the cab of the engine with them." 

"Not really!" 

"Please do attend the opening. It's on July twenty-second. The press is 
most eagerly invited. Contrary to my usual policy, I have become a publicity 
hound. Really. I should like to have spotlights, radio microphones and 
television cameras. I suggest that you plant a few cameras around the bridge. 
The collapse of the bridge would give you some interesting shots." 

"Miss Taggart," asked Rearden, "why didn't you mention that I'm going to 
ride in that engine, too?" 

She looked at him across the room, and for a moment they were alone, 
holding each other's glance. 

"Yes, of course, Mr. Rearden," she answered. 

She did not see him again until they looked at each other across the 
platform of the Taggart station in Cheyenne, on July 22. 

She did not look for anyone when she stepped out on the platform: she felt 
as if her senses had merged, so that she could not distinguish the sky, the 
sun or the sounds of an enormous crowd, but perceived only a sensation of 
shock and light. 

Yet he was the first person she saw, and she could not tell for how long a 
time he was also the only one. He stood by the engine of the John Gait train, 
talking to somebody outside the field of her consciousness. 

He was dressed in gray slacks and shirt, he looked like an expert 
mechanic, but he was stared at by the faces around him, because he was Hank 
Rearden of Rearden Steel. High above him, she saw the letters TT on the 
silver front of the engine. The lines of the engine slanted back, aimed at 
space . 

There was distance and a crowd between them, but his eyes moved to her the 
moment she came out. They looked at each other and she knew that he felt as 
she did. This was not to be a solemn venture upon which their future 
depended, but simply their day of enjoyment. Their work was done. For the 
moment, there was no future. They had earned the present. 

Only if one feels immensely important, she had told him, can one feel 
truly light. Whatever the train's run would mean to others, for the two of 



them their own persons were this day's sole meaning. Whatever it was that 
others sought in life, their right to what they now felt was all the two of 
them wished to find. It was as if, across the platform, they said it to each 
other . 

Then she turned away from him. 

She noticed that she, too, was being stared at, that there were people 
around her, that she was laughing and answering questions. 

She had not expected such a large crowd. They filled the platform, the 
tracks, the square beyond the station; they were on the roofs of the boxcars 
on the sidings, at the windows of every house in sight. Something had drawn 
them here, something in the air which, at the last moment, had made James 
Taggart want to attend the opening of the John Gait Line. She had forbidden 
it. "If you come, Jim," she had said, "I'll have you thrown out of your own 
Taggart station. This is one event you're not going to see." Then she had 
chosen Eddie Willers to represent Taggart Transcontinental at the opening. 

She looked at the crowd and she felt, simultaneously, astonishment that 
they should stare at her, when this event was so personally her own that no 
communication about it was possible, and a sense of fitness that they should 
be here, that they should want to see it, because the sight of an achievement 
was the greatest gift a human being could offer to others. 

She felt no anger toward anyone on earth. The things she had endured had 
now receded into some outer fog, like pain that still exists, but has no 
power to hurt. Those things could not stand in the face of this moment's 
reality, the meaning of this day was as brilliantly, violently clear as the 
splashes of sun on the silver of the engine, all men had to perceive it now, 
no one could doubt it and she had no one to hate. 

Eddie Willers was watching her. He stood on the platform, surrounded by 
Taggart executives, division heads, civic leaders, and the various local 
officials who had been out argued, bribed or threatened, to obtain permits to 
run a train through town zones at a hundred miles an hour. For once, for this 
day and event, his title of Vice-president was real to him and he carried it 
well. But while he spoke to those around him, his eyes kept following Dagny 
through the crowd. She was dressed in blue slacks and shirt, she was 
unconscious of official duties, she had left them to him, the train was now 
her sole concern, as if she were only a member of its crew. 

She saw him, she approached, and she shook his hand; her smile was like a 
summation of all the things they did not have to say. "Well, Eddie, you're 
Taggart Transcontinental now." 

"Yes," he said solemnly, his voice low. 

There were reporters asking questions, and they dragged her away from him. 
They were asking him questions, too. "Mr. Willers, what is the policy of 
Taggart Transcontinental in regard to this line?" "So Taggart 
Transcontinental is just a disinterested observer, is it, Mr. Willers?" 

He answered as best he could. He was looking at the sun on a Diesel 
engine. But what he was seeing was the sun in a clearing of the woods and a 
twelve-year-old girl telling him that he would help her run the railroad some 
day. 

He watched from a distance while the train's crew was lined up in front of 
the engine, to face a firing squad of cameras. Dagny and Rearden were 
smiling, as if posing for snapshots of a summer vacation. Pat Logan, the 
engineer, a short, sinewy man with graying hair and a contemptuously 
inscrutable face, posed in a manner of amused indifference. 

Ray McKim, the fireman, a husky young giant, grinned with an air of 
embarrassment and superiority together. The rest of the crew looked as if 
they were about to wink at the cameras. A photographer said, laughing, "Can't 
you people look doomed, please? I know that's what the editor wants." 



Dagny and Rearden were answering questions for the press. There was no 
mockery in their answers now, no bitterness. They were enjoying it. They 
spoke as if the questions were asked in good faith. Irresistibly, at some 
point which no one noticed, this became true, "What do you expect to happen 
on this run?" a reporter asked one of the brakemen. "Do you think you'll get 
there?" 

"I think we'll get there," said the brakeman, "and so do you, brother." 

"Mr. Logan, do you have any children? Did you take out any extra 
insurance? I'm just thinking of the bridge, you know." 

"Don't cross that bridge till I come to it," Pat Logan answered 
contemptuously. 

"Mr. Rearden, how do you know that your rail will hold?" 

'The man who taught people to make a printing press," said Rearden, "how 
did he know it?" 

"Tell me, Miss Taggart, what's going to support a seven-thousand-ton train 
on a three-thousand-ton bridge?" 
"My judgment," she answered. 

The men of the press, who despised their own profession, did not know why 
they were enjoying it today. One of them, a young man with years of notorious 
success behind him and a cynical look of twice his age, said suddenly, "I 
know what I'd like to be: I wish I could be a man who covers news!" 

The hands of the clock on the station building stood at 3:45. The crew 
started off toward the caboose at the distant end of the train. The movement 
and noise of the crowd were subsiding. Without conscious intention, people 
were beginning to stand still. 

The dispatcher had received word from every local operator along the line 
of rail that wound through the mountains to the Wyatt oil fields three 
hundred miles away. He came out of the station building and, looking at 
Dagny, gave the signal for clear track ahead. Standing by the engine, Dagny 
raised her hand, repeating his gesture in sign of an order received and 
understood. 

The long line of boxcars stretched off into the distance, in spaced, 
rectangular links, like a spinal cord. When the conductor's arm swept through 
the air, far at the end, she moved her arm in answering signal. 

Rearden, Logan and McKim stood silently, as if at attention, letting her 
be first to get aboard. As she started up the rungs on the side of the 
engine, a reporter thought of a question he had not asked. 

"Miss Taggart," he called after her, "who is John Gait?" 

She turned, hanging onto a metal bar with one hand, suspended for an 
instant above the heads of the crowd. 

"We are!" she answered. 

Logan followed her into the cab, then McKim; Rearden went last, then the 
door of the engine was shut, with the tight finality of sealed metal. 

The lights, hanging on a signal bridge against the sky, were green. 

There were green lights between the tracks, low over the ground, dropping 
off into the distance where the rails turned and a green light stood at the 
curve, against leaves of a summer green that looked as if they, too, were 
lights . 

Two men held a white silk ribbon stretched across the track in front of 
the engine. They were the superintendent of the Colorado Division and Nealy's 
chief engineer, who had remained on the job. Eddie Willers was to cut the 
ribbon they held and thus to open the new line. 

The photographers posed him carefully, scissors in hand, his back to the 
engine. He would repeat the ceremony two or three times, they explained, to 
give them a choice of shots; they had a fresh bolt of ribbon ready. He was 
about to comply, then stopped. "No, " he said suddenly. 

"It's not going to be a phony." 



In a voice of quiet authority, the voice of a vice-president, he ordered, 
pointing at the cameras, "Stand back— way back. Take one shot when I cut it, 
then get out of the way, fast." 

They obeyed, moving hastily farther down the track. There was only one 
minute left. Eddie turned his back to the cameras and stood between the 
rails, facing the engine. He held the scissors ready over the white ribbon. 
He took his hat off and tossed it aside. He was looking up at the engine. A 
faint wind stirred his blond hair. The engine was a great silver shield 
bearing the emblem of Nat Taggart. 

Eddie Willers raised his hand as the hand of the station clock reached the 
instant of four. 

"Open her up, Pat!" he called. 

In the moment when the engine started forward, he cut the white ribbon and 
leaped out of the way. 

From the side track, he saw the window of the cab go by and Dagny waving 
to him in an answering salute. Then the engine was gone, and he stood looking 
across at the crowded platform that kept appearing and vanishing as the 
freight cars clicked past him. 

The green-blue rails ran to meet them, like two jets shot out of a single 
point beyond the curve of the earth. The crossties melted, as they 
approached, into a smooth stream rolling down under the wheels. A blurred 
streak clung to the side of the engine, low over the ground. Trees and 
telegraph poles sprang into sight abruptly and went by as if jerked back. The 
green plains stretched past, in a leisurely flow. At the edge of the sky, a 
long wave of mountains reversed the movement and seemed to follow the train. 

She felt no wheels under the floor. The motion was a smooth flight on a 
sustained impulse, as if the engine hung above the rails, riding a current. 
She felt no speed. It seemed strange that the green lights of the signals 
kept coming at them and past, every few seconds. She knew that the signal 
lights were spaced two miles apart. 

The needle on the speedometer in front of Pat Logan stood at one hundred. 

She sat in the fireman's chair and glanced across at Logan once in a 
while. He sat slumped forward a little, relaxed, one hand resting lightly on 
the throttle as if by chance; but his eyes were fixed on the track ahead. He 
had the ease of an expert, so confident that it seemed casual, but it was the 
ease of a tremendous concentration, the concentration on one's task that has 
the ruthlessness of an absolute. Ray McKim sat on a bench behind them. 
Rearden stood in the middle of the cab. 

He stood, hands in pockets, feet apart, braced against the motion, looking 
ahead. There was nothing he could now care to see by the side of the track: 
he was looking at the rail. 

Ownership— she thought, glancing back at him— weren't there those who knew 
nothing of its nature and doubted its reality? No, it was not made of papers, 
seals, grants and permissions. There it was— in his eyes. 

The sound filling the cab seemed part of the space they were crossing. It 
held the low drone of the motors— the sharper clicking of the many parts that 
rang in varied cries of metal— and the high, thin chimes of trembling glass 
panes . 

Things streaked past— a water tank, a tree, a shanty, a grain silo. 

They had a windshield-wiper motion: they were rising, describing a curve 
and dropping back. The telegraph wires ran a race with the train, rising and 
falling from pole to pole, in an even rhythm, like the cardiograph record of 
a steady heartbeat written across the sky. 

She looked ahead, at the haze that melted rail and distance, a haze that 
could rip apart at any moment to some shape of disaster. She wondered why she 
felt safer than she had ever felt in a car behind the engine, safer here, 
where it seemed as if, should an obstacle rise, her breast and the glass 



shield would be first to smash against it. She smiled, grasping the answer: 
it was the security of being first, with full sight and full knowledge of 
one's course— not the blind sense of being pulled into the unknown by some 
unknown power ahead. It was the greatest sensation of existence: not to 
trust, but to know. 

The glass sheets of the cab's windows made the spread of the fields seem 
vaster: the earth looked as open to movement as it was to sight. 

Yet nothing was distant and nothing was out of reach. She had barely 
grasped the sparkle of a lake ahead— and in the next instant she was beside 
it, then past. 

It was a strange foreshortening between sight and touch, she thought, 
between wish and fulfillment, between— the words clicked sharply in her mind 
after a startled stop— between spirit and body. First, the vision— then the 
physical shape to express it. First, the thought— then the purposeful motion 
down the straight line of a single track to a chosen goal. Could one have any 
meaning without the other? Wasn't it evil to wish without moving— or to move 
without aim? Whose malevolence was it that crept through the world, 
struggling to break the two apart and set them against each other? 

She shook her head. She did not want to think or to wonder why the world 
behind her was as it was. She did not care. She was flying away from it, at 
the rate of a hundred miles an hour. She leaned to the open window by her 
side, and felt the wind of the speed blowing her hair off her forehead. She 
lay back, conscious of nothing but the pleasure it gave her. 

Yet her mind kept racing. Broken bits of thought flew past her attention, 
like the telegraph poles by the track. Physical pleasure?— she thought. This 
is a train made of steel . . . running on rails of Rearden Metal . . . moved 
by the energy of burning oil and electric generators . . . it's a physical 
sensation of physical movement through space . . . but is that the cause and 
the meaning of what I now feel? 

. . . Do they call it a low, animal joy— this feeling that I would not care 
if the rail did break to bits under us now— it won ' t— but I wouldn't care, 
because I have experienced this? A low, physical, material, degrading 
pleasure of the body? 

She smiled, her eyes closed, the wind streaming through her hair. 

She opened her eyes and saw that Rearden stood looking down at her. It was 
the same glance with which he had looked at the rail. She felt her power of 
volition knocked out by some single, dull blow that made her unable to move. 
She held his eyes, lying back in her chair, the wind pressing the thin cloth 
of her shirt to her body. 

He looked away, and she turned again to the sight of the earth tearing 
open before them. 

She did not want to think, but the sound of thought went on, like the 
drone of the motors under the sounds of the engine. She looked at the cab 
around her. The fine steel mesh of the ceiling, she thought, and the row of 
rivets in the corner, holding sheets of steel sealed together— who made them? 
The brute force of men's muscles? Who made it possible for four dials and 
three levers in front of Pat Logan to hold the incredible power of the 
sixteen motors behind them and deliver it to the effortless control of one 
man ' s hand? 

These things and the capacity from which they came— was this the pursuit 
men regarded as evil? Was this what they called an ignoble concern with the 
physical world? Was this the state of being enslaved by matter? Was this the 
surrender of man's spirit to his body? 

She shook her head, as if she wished she could toss the subject out of the 
window and let it get shattered somewhere along the track. She looked at the 
sun on the summer fields. She did not have to think, because these questions 
were only details of a truth she knew and had always known. Let them go past 



like the telegraph poles. The thing she knew was like the wires flying above 
in an unbroken line. The words for it, and for this journey, and for her 
feeling, and for the whole of man's earth, were: It's so simple and so right! 

She looked out at the country. She had been aware for some time of the 
human figures that flashed with an odd regularity at the side of the track. 
But they went by so fast that she could not grasp their meaning until, like 
the squares of a movie film, brief flashes blended into a whole and she 
understood it. She had had the track guarded since its completion, but she 
had not hired the human chain she saw strung out along the right-of-way. A 
solitary figure stood at every mile post. Some were young schoolboys, others 
were so old that the silhouettes of their bodies looked bent against the sky. 
All of them were armed, with anything they had found, from costly rifles to 
ancient muskets. All of them wore railroad caps. They were the sons of 
Taggart employees, and old railroad men who had retired after a full lifetime 
of Taggart service. They had come, unsummoned, to guard this train. As the 
engine went past him, every man in his turn stood erect, at attention, and 
raised his gun in a military salute. 

When she grasped it, she burst out laughing, suddenly, with the abruptness 
of a cry. She laughed, shaking, like a child; it sounded like sobs of 
deliverance. Pat Logan nodded to her with a faint smile; he had noted the 
guard of honor long ago. She leaned to the open window, and her arm swept in 
wide curves of triumph, waving to the men by the track. 

On the crest of a distant hill, she saw a crowd of people, their arms 
swinging against the sky. The gray houses of a village were scattered through 
a valley below, as if dropped there once and forgotten; the roof lines 
slanted, sagging, and the years had washed away the color of the walls. 
Perhaps generations had lived there, with nothing to mark the passage of 
their days but the movement of the sun from east to west. 

Now, these men had climbed the hill to see a silver-headed comet cut 
through their plains like the sound of a bugle through a long weight of 
silence . 

As houses began to come more frequently, closer to the track, she saw 
people at the windows, on the porches, on distant roofs. She saw crowds 
blocking the roads at grade crossings. The roads went sweeping past like the 
spokes of a fan, and she could not distinguish human figures, only their arms 
greeting the train like branches waving in the wind of its speed. They stood 
under the swinging red lights of warning signals, under the signs saying; 
"Stop. Look. Listen." 

The station past which they flew, as they went through a town at a hundred 
miles an hour, was a swaying sculpture of people from platform to roof. She 
caught the flicker of waving arms, of hats tossed in the air, of something 
flung against the side of the engine, which was a bunch of flowers. 

As the miles clicked past them, the towns went by, with the stations at 
which they did not stop, with the crowds of people who had come only to see, 
to cheer and to hope. She saw garlands of flowers under the sooted eaves of 
old station buildings, and bunting of red-white-and-blue on the time-eaten 
walls. It was like the pictures she had seen— and envied— in schoolbook 
histories of railroads, from the era when people gathered to greet the first 
run of a train. It was like the age when Nat Taggart moved across the 
country, and the stops along his way were marked by men eager for the sight 
of achievement. That age, she had thought, was gone; generations had passed, 
with no event to greet anywhere, with nothing to see but the cracks 
lengthening year by year on the walls built by Nat Taggart. Yet men came 
again, as they had come in his time, drawn by the same response. 

She glanced at Rearden. He stood against the wall, unaware of the crowds, 
indifferent to admiration. He was watching the performance of track and train 
with an expert's intensity of professional interest; his bearing suggested 



that he would kick aside, as irrelevant, any thought such as 'They like it," 
when the thought ringing in his mind was "It works!" 

His tall figure in the single gray of slacks and shirt looked as if his 
body were stripped for action. The slacks stressed the long lines of his 
legs, the light, firm posture of standing without effort or being ready to 
swing forward at an instant's notice; the short sleeves stressed the gaunt 
strength of his arms; the open shirt bared the tight skin of his chest. 

She turned away, realizing suddenly that she had been glancing back at him 
too often. But this day had no ties to past or future— her thoughts were cut 
off from implications— she saw no further meaning, only the immediate 
intensity of the feeling that she was imprisoned with him, sealed together in 
the same cube of air, the closeness of his presence underscoring her 
awareness of this day, as his rails underscored the flight of the train. 

She turned deliberately and glanced back. He was looking at her. 

He did not turn away, but held her glance, coldly and with full intention. 

She smiled defiantly, not letting herself know the full meaning of her 
smile, knowing only that it was the sharpest blow she could strike at his 
inflexible face. She felt a sudden desire to see him trembling, to tear a cry 
out of him. She turned her head away, slowly, feeling a reckless amusement, 
wondering why she found it difficult to breathe. 

She sat leaning back in her chair, looking ahead, knowing that he was as 
aware of her as she was of him. She found pleasure in the special self- 
consciousness it gave her. When she crossed her legs, when she leaned on her 
arm against the window sill, when she brushed her hair off her forehead— every 
movement of her body was underscored by a feeling the unadmitted words for 
which were: Is he seeing it? 

The towns had been left behind. The track was rising through a country 
growing more grimly reluctant to permit approach. The rails kept vanishing 
behind curves, and the ridges of hills kept moving closer, as if the plains 
were being folded into pleats. The flat stone shelves of Colorado were 
advancing to the edge of the track— and the distant reaches of the sky were 
shrinking into waves of bluish mountains. 

Far ahead, they saw a mist of smoke over factory chimneys— then the web of 
a power station and the lone needle of a steel structure. They were 
approaching Denver. 

She glanced at Pat Logan. He was leaning forward a little farther; she saw 
a slight tightening in the fingers of his hand and in his eyes. He knew, as 
she did, the danger of crossing a city at the speed they were traveling. 

It was a succession of minutes, but it hit them as a single whole. First, 
they saw the lone shapes, which were factories, rolling across their 
windowpanes— then the shapes fused into the blur of streets— then a delta of 
rails spread out before them, like the mouth of a funnel sucking them into 
the Taggart station, with nothing to protect them but the small green beads 
of lights scattered over the ground— from the height of the cab, they saw 
boxcars on sidings streak past as flat ribbons of roof tops —the black hole 
of the train-shed flew at their faces— they hurtled through an explosion of 
sound, the beating of wheels against the glass panes of a vault, and the 
screams of cheering from a mass that swayed like a liquid in the darkness 
among steel columns— they flew toward a glowing arch and the green lights 
hanging in the open sky beyond, the green lights that were like the doorknobs 
of space, throwing door after door open before them. Then, vanishing behind 
them, went the streets clotted with traffic, the open windows bulging with 
human figures, the screaming sirens, and— from the top of a distant 
skyscraper— a cloud of paper snowflakes shimmering on the air, flung by 
someone who saw the passage of a silver bullet across a city stopped still to 
watch it. 



Then they were out again, on a rocky grade— and with shocking suddenness, 
the mountains were before them, as if the city had flung them straight at a 
granite wall, and a thin ledge had caught them in time. They were clinging to 
the side of a vertical cliff, with the earth rolling down, dropping away, and 
giant tiers of twisted boulders streaming up and shutting out the sun, 
leaving them to speed through a bluish twilight, with no sight of soil or 
sky. 

The curves of rail became coiling circles among walls that advanced to 
grind them off their sides. But the track cut through at times and the 
mountains parted, flaring open like two wings at the tip of the rail— one wing 
green, made of vertical needles, with whole pines serving as the pile of a 
solid carpet— the other reddish-brown, made of naked rock. 

She looked down through the open window and saw the silver side of the 
engine hanging over empty space. Far below, the thin thread of a stream went 
falling from ledge to ledge, and the ferns that drooped to the water were the 
shimmering tops of birch trees. She saw the engine's tail of boxcars winding 
along the face of a granite drop— and miles of contorted stone below, she saw 
the coils of green-blue rail unwinding behind the train. 

A wall of rock shot upward in their path, filling the windshield, 
darkening the cab, so close that it seemed as if the remnant of time could 
not let them escape it. But she heard the screech of wheels on curve, the 
light came bursting back— and she saw an open stretch of rail on a narrow 
shelf. The shelf ended in space. The nose of the engine was aimed straight at 
the sky. There was nothing to stop them but two strips of green-blue metal 
strung in a curve along the shelf. 

To take the pounding violence of sixteen motors, she thought, the thrust 
of seven thousand tons of steel and freight, to withstand it, grip it and 
swing it around a curve, was the impossible feat performed by two strips of 
metal no wider than her arm. What made it possible? What power had given to 
an unseen arrangement of molecules the power on which their lives depended 
and the lives of all the men who waited for the eighty boxcars? She saw a 
man's face and hands in the glow of a laboratory oven, over the white liquid 
of a sample of metal. 

She felt the sweep of an emotion which she could not contain, as of 
something bursting upward. She turned to the door of the motor units, she 
threw it open to a screaming jet of sound and escaped into the pounding of 
the engine's heart. 

For a moment, it was as if she were reduced to a single sense, the sense 
of hearing, and what remained of her hearing was only a long, rising, 
falling, rising scream. She stood in a swaying, sealed chamber of metal, 
looking at the giant generators. She had wanted to see them, because the 
sense of triumph within her was bound to them, to her love for them, to the 
reason of the life-work she had chosen. In the abnormal clarity of a violent 
emotion, she felt as if she were about to grasp something she had never known 
and had to know. She laughed aloud, but heard no sound of it; nothing could 
be heard through the continuous explosion. "The John Gait Line!" she shouted, 
for the amusement of feeling her voice swept away from her lips. 

She moved slowly along the length of the motor units, down a narrow 
passage between the engines and the wall. She felt the immodesty of an 
intruder, as if she had slipped inside a living creature, under its silver 
skin, and were watching its life beating in gray metal cylinders, in twisted 
coils, in sealed tubes, in the convulsive whirl of blades in wire cages. The 
enormous complexity of the shape above her was drained by invisible channels, 
and the violence raging within it was led to fragile needles on glass dials, 
to green and red beads winking on panels, to tall, thin cabinets stenciled 
"High Voltage." 



Why had she always felt that joyous sense of confidence when looking at 
machines ?— she thought. In these giant shapes, two aspects pertaining to the 
inhuman were radiantly absent: the causeless and the purposeless. Every part 
of the motors was an embodied answer to "Why?" 

and "What for?"— like the steps of a life-course chosen by the sort of mind 
she worshipped. The motors were a moral code cast in steel. 

They are alive, she thought, because they are the physical shape of the 
action of a living power— of the mind that had been able to grasp the whole of 
this complexity, to set its purpose, to give it form. For an instant, it 
seemed to her that the motors were transparent and she was seeing the net of 
their nervous system. It was a net of connections, more intricate, more 
crucial than all of their wires and circuits: the rational connections made 
by that human mind which had fashioned any one part of them for the first 
time . 

They are alive, she thought, but their soul operates them by remote 
control. Their soul is in every man who has the capacity to equal this 
achievement. Should the soul vanish from the earth, the motors would stop, 
because that is the power which keeps them going— not the oil under the floor 
under her feet, the oil that would then become primeval ooze again— not the 
steel cylinders that would become stains of rust on the walls of the caves of 
shivering savages— the power of a living mind —the power of thought and choice 
and purpose. 

She was making her way back toward the cab, feeling that she wanted to 
laugh, to kneel or to lift her arms, wishing she were able to release the 
thing she felt, knowing that it had no form of expression. 

She stopped She saw Rearden standing by the steps of the door to the cab. 
He was looking at her as if he knew why she had escaped and what she felt. 
They stood still, their bodies becoming a glance that met across a narrow 
passage. The beating within her was one with the beating of the motors— and 
she felt as if both came from him; the pounding rhythm wiped out her will. 
They went back to the cab, silently, knowing that there had been a moment 
which was not to be mentioned between them. 

The cliffs ahead were a bright, liquid gold. Strips of shadow were 
lengthening in the valleys below. The sun was descending to the peaks in the 
west. They were going west and up, toward the sun. 

The sky had deepened to the greenish-blue of the rails, when they saw 
smokestacks in a distant valley. It was one of Colorado's new towns, the 
towns that had grown like a radiation from the Wyatt oil fields. She saw the 
angular lines of modern houses, flat roofs, great sheets of windows. It was 
too far to distinguish people. In the moment when she thought that they would 
not be watching the train at that distance, a rocket shot out from among the 
buildings, rose high above the town and broke as a fountain of gold stars 
against the darkening sky. Men whom she could not see, were seeing the streak 
of the train on the side of the mountain, and were sending a salute, a lonely 
plume of fire in the dusk, the symbol of celebration or of a call for help. 

Beyond the next turn, in a sudden view of distance, she saw two dots of 
electric light, white and red, low in the sky. They were not airplanes '—she 
saw the cones of metal girders supporting them— and in the moment when she 
knew that they were the derricks of Wyatt Oil, she saw that the track was 
sweeping downward, that the earth flared open, as if the mountains were flung 
apart— and at the bottom, at the foot of the Wyatt hill, across the dark crack 
of a canyon, she saw the bridge of Rearden Metal. 

They were flying down, she forgot the careful grading, the great curves of 
the gradual descent, she felt as if the train were plunging downward, head 
first, she watched the bridge growing to meet them— a small, square tunnel of 
metal lace work, a few beams criss-crossed through the air, green-blue and 
glowing, struck by a long ray of sunset light from some crack in the barrier 



of mountains. There were people by the bridge, the dark splash of a crowd, 
but they rolled off the edge of her consciousness. She heard the rising, 
accelerating sound of the wheels— and some theme of music, heard to the rhythm 
of wheels, kept tugging at her mind, growing louder— it burst suddenly within 
the cab, but she knew that it was only in her mind; the Fifth Concerto by 
Richard Halley— she thought: did he write it for this? had he known a feeling 
such as this?— 

they were going faster, they had left the ground, she thought, flung off 
by the mountains as by a springboard, they were now sailing through space- 
it's not a fair test, she thought, we're not going to touch that bridge— she 
saw Rearden's face above her, she held his eyes and her head leaned back, so 
that her face lay still on the air under his face— 

they heard a ringing blast of metal, they heard a drum roll under their 
feet, the diagonals of the bridge went smearing across the windows with the 
sound of a metal rod being run along the pickets of a fence— then the windows 
were too suddenly clear, the sweep of their downward plunge was carrying them 
up a hill, the derricks of Wyatt Oil were reeling before them— Pat Logan 
turned, glancing up at Rearden with the hint of a smile— and Rearden said, 
"That's that." 

The sign on the edge of a roof read: Wyatt Junction. She stared, feeling 
that there was something odd about it, until she grasped what it was: the 
sign did not move. The sharpest jolt of the journey was the realization that 
the engine stood still. 

She heard voices somewhere, she looked down and saw that there were people 
on the platform. Then the door of the cab was flung open, she knew that she 
had to be first to descend, and she stepped to the edge. 

For the flash of an instant, she felt the slenderness of her own body, the 
lightness of standing full-figure in a current of open air. She gripped the 
metal bars and started down the ladder. She was halfway down when she felt 
the palms of a man's hands slam tight against her ribs and waistline, she was 
torn off the steps, swung through the air and deposited on the ground. She 
could not believe that the young boy laughing in her face was Ellis Wyatt. 
The tense, scornful face she remembered, now had the purity, the eagerness, 
the joyous benevolence of a child in the kind of world for which he had been 
intended . 

She was leaning against his shoulder, feeling unsteady on the motionless 
ground, with his arm about her, she was laughing, she was listening to the 
things he said, she was answering, "But didn't you know we would?" 

In a moment, she saw the faces around them. They were the bondholders of 
the John Gait Line, the men who were Nielsen Motors, Hammond Cars, Stockton 
Foundry and all the others. She shook their hands, and there were no 
speeches; she stood against Ellis Wyatt, sagging a little, brushing her hair 
away from her eyes, leaving smudges of soot on her forehead. She shook the 
hands of the men of the train's crew, without words, with the seal of the 
grins on their faces. There were flash bulbs exploding around them, and men 
waving to them from the riggings of the oil wells on the slopes of the 
mountains. Above her head, above the heads of the crowd, the letters TT on a 
silver shield were hit by the last ray of a sinking sun. 

Ellis Wyatt had taken charge. He was leading her somewhere, the sweep of 
his arm cutting a path for them through the crowd, when one of the men with 
the cameras broke through to her side. "Miss Taggart, " 

he called, "will you give us a message for the public?" Ellis Wyatt 
pointed at the long string of freight cars. "She has." 

Then she was sitting in the back seat of an open car, driving up the 
curves of a mountain road. The man beside her was Rearden, the driver was 
Ellis Wyatt. 



They stopped at a house that stood on the edge of a cliff, with no other 
habitation anywhere in sight, with the whole of the oil fields spread on the 
slopes below. 

"Why, of course you're staying at my house overnight, both of you," 

said Ellis Wyatt, as they went in. "Where did you expect to stay?" 

She laughed. "I don't know, I hadn't thought of it at all." 

"The nearest town is an hour's drive away. That's where your crew has 
gone: your boys at the division point are giving a party in their honor. So 
is the whole town. But I told Ted Nielsen and the others that we'd have no 
banquets for you and no oratory. Unless you'd like it?" 

"God, no!" she said. "Thanks, Ellis." 

It was dark when they sat at the dinner table in a room that had large 
windows and a few pieces of costly furniture. The dinner was served by a 
silent figure in a white jacket, the only other inhabitant of the house, an 
elderly Indian with a stony face and a courteous manner. A few points of fire 
were scattered through the room, running over and out beyond the windows: the 
candles on the table, the lights on the derricks, and the stars. 

"Do you think that you have your hands full now?" Ellis Wyatt was saying. 
"Just give me a year and I'll give you something to keep you busy. Two tank 
trains a day, Dagny? It's going to be four or six or as many as you wish me 
to fill." His hand swept over the lights on the mountains. "This? It's 
nothing, compared to what I've got coming." He pointed west. "The Buena 
Esperanza Pass. Five miles from here. Everybody's wondering what I'm doing 
with it. Oil shale. How many years ago was it that they gave up trying to get 
oil from shale, because it was too expensive? Well, wait till you see the 
process I've developed. It will be the cheapest oil ever to splash in their 
faces, and an unlimited supply of it, an untapped supply that will make the 
biggest oil pool look like a mud puddle. Did I order a pipe line? Hank, you 
and I will have to build pipe lines in all directions to . . . Oh, I beg your 
pardon. I don't believe I introduced myself when I spoke to you at the 
station. I haven't even told you my name." 

Rearden grinned. "I've guessed it by now." 

"I'm sorry, I don't like to be careless, but I was too excited." 

"What were you excited about?" asked Dagny, her eyes narrowed in mockery. 

Wyatt held her glance for a moment; his answer had a tone of solemn 
intensity strangely conveyed by a smiling voice. "About the most beautiful 
slap in the face I ever got and deserved." 

"Do you mean, for our first meeting?" 

"I mean, for our first meeting." 

"Don't. You were right." 

"I was. About everything but you. Dagny, to find an exception after years 
of . . . Oh, to hell with them! Do you want me to turn on the radio and hear 
what they're saying about the two of you tonight?" 

"No . " 

"Good. I don't want to hear them. Let them swallow their own speeches. 
They're all climbing on the band wagon now. We're the band." 
He glanced at Rearden. "What are you smiling at?" 
"I've always been curious to see what you're like." 
"I've never had a chance to be what I'm like— except tonight." 
"Do you live here alone, like this, miles away from everything?" 
Wyatt pointed at the window. "I'm a couple of steps away from— 
everything . " 
"What about people?" 

"I have guest rooms for the kind of people who come to see me on business. 
I want as many miles as possible between myself and all the other kinds." He 
leaned forward to refill their wine glasses. "Hank, why don't you move to 
Colorado? To hell with New York and the Eastern Seaboard! This is the capital 



of the Renaissance. The Second Renaissance— not of oil paintings and 
cathedrals— but of oil derricks, power plants, and motors made of Rearden 
Metal. They had the Stone Age and the Iron Age and now they're going to call 
it the Rearden Metal Age— because there's no limit to what your Metal has made 
possible . " 

"I'm going to buy a few square miles of Pennsylvania," said Rearden. 

"The ones around my mills. It would have been cheaper to build a branch 
here, as I wanted, but you know why I can't, and to hell with them! Ill beat 
them anyway. I'm going to expand the mills— and if she can give me three-day 
freight service to Colorado, I'll give you a race for who's going to be the 
capital of the Renaissance!" 

"Give me a year, " said Dagny, "of running trains on the John Gait Line, 
give me time to pull the Taggart system together— and I'll give you three-day 
freight service across the continent, on a Rearden Metal track from ocean to 
ocean ! " 

"Who was it that said he needed a fulcrum?" said Ellis Wyatt. "Give me an 
unobstructed right-of-way and I'll show them how to move the earth!" 

She wondered what it was that she liked about the sound of Wyatt ' s 
laughter. Their voices, even her own, had a tone she had never heard before. 
When they rose from the table, she was astonished to notice that the candles 
were the only illumination of the room: she had felt as if she were sitting 
in a violent light. 

Ellis Wyatt picked up his glass, looked at their faces and said, "To the 
world as it seems to be right now!" 

He emptied the glass with a single movement. 

She heard the crash of the glass against the wall in the same instant that 
she saw a circling current— from the curve of his body to the sweep of his arm 
to the terrible violence of his hand that flung the glass across the room. It 
was not the conventional gesture meant as celebration, it was the gesture of 
a rebellious anger, the vicious gesture which is movement substituted for a 
scream of pain. 

"Ellis," she whispered, "what's the matter?" 

He turned to look at her. With the same violent suddenness, his eyes were 
clear, his face was calm; what frightened her was seeing him smile gently. 
"I'm sorry," he said. "Never mind. We'll try to think that it will last." 

The earth below was streaked with moonlight, when Wyatt led them up an 
outside stairway to the second floor of the house, to the open gallery at the 
doors of the guest rooms. He wished them good night and they heard his steps 
descending the stairs. The moonlight seemed to drain sound as it drained 
color. The steps rolled into a distant past, and when they died, the silence 
had the quality of a solitude that had lasted for a long time, as if no 
person were left anywhere in reach. 

She did not turn to the door of her room. He did not move. At the level of 
their feet, there was nothing but a thin railing and a spread of space. 
Angular tiers descended below, with shadows repeating the steel tracery of 
derricks, criss-crossing sharp, black lines on patches of glowing rock. A few 
lights, white and red, trembled in the clear air, like drops of rain caught 
on the edges of steel girders. Far in the distance, three small drops were 
green, strung in a line along the Taggart track. 

Beyond them, at the end of space, at the foot of a white curve, hung a 
webbed rectangle which was the bridge. 

She felt a rhythm without sound or movement, a sense of beating tension, 
as if the wheels of the John Gait Line were still speeding on. 

Slowly, in answer and in resistance to an unspoken summons, she turned and 
looked at him. 

The look she saw on his face made her know for the first time that she had 
known this would be the end of the journey. That look was not as men are 



taught to represent it, it was not a matter of loose muscles, hanging lips 
and mindless hunger. The lines of his face were pulled tight, giving it a 
peculiar purity, a sharp precision of form, making it clean and young. His 
mouth was taut, the lips faintly drawn inward, stressing the outline of its 
shape. Only his eyes were blurred, their lower lids swollen and raised, their 
glance intent with that which resembled hatred and pain. 

The shock became numbness spreading through her body— she felt a tight 
pressure in her throat and her stomach— she was conscious of nothing but a 
silent convulsion that made her unable to breathe. But what she felt, without 
words for it, was: Yes, Hank, yes— now— because it is part of the same battle, 
in some way that I can't name . . . because it is our being, against theirs . 
. . our great capacity, for which they torture us, the capacity of happiness 
. . . Now, like this, without words or questions . . . because we want it. . 

It was like an act of hatred, like the cutting blow of a lash encircling 
her body: she felt his arms around her, she felt her legs pulled forward 
against him and her chest bent back under the pressure of his, his mouth on 
hers . 

Her hand moved from his shoulders to his waist to his legs, releasing the 
unconfessed desire of her every meeting with him. When she tore her mouth 
away from him, she was laughing soundlessly, in triumph, as if saying: Hank 
Rearden— the austere, unapproachable Hank Rearden of the monk like office, the 
business conferences, the harsh bargains— do you remember them now?— I'm 
thinking of it, for the pleasure of knowing that I've brought you to this. He 
was not smiling, his face was tight, it was the face of an enemy, he jerked 
her head and caught her mouth again, as if he were inflicting a wound. 

She felt him trembling and she thought that this was the kind of cry she 
had wanted to tear from him— this surrender through the shreds of his tortured 
resistance. Yet she knew, at the same time, that the triumph was his, that 
her laughter was her tribute to him, that her defiance was submission, that 
the purpose of all of her violent strength was only to make his victory the 
greater— he was holding her body against his, as if stressing his wish to let 
her know that she was now only a tool for the satisfaction of his desire— and 
his victory, she knew, was her wish to let him reduce her to that. Whatever I 
am, she thought, whatever pride of person I may hold, the pride of my 
courage, of my work, of my mind and my freedom— that is what I offer you for 
the pleasure of your body, that is what I want you to use in your service— and 
that you want it to serve you is the greatest reward I can have. 

There were lights burning in the two rooms behind them. He took her wrist 
and threw her inside his room, making the gesture tell her that he needed no 
sign of consent or resistance. He locked the door, watching her face. 
Standing straight, holding his glance, she extended her arm to the lamp on 
the table and turned out the light. He approached. He turned the light on 
again, with a single, contemptuous jerk of his wrist. 

She saw him smile for the first time, a slow, mocking, sensual smile that 
stressed the purpose of his action. 

He was holding her half-stretched across the bed, he was tearing her 
clothes off. while her face was pressed against him, her mouth, moving down 
the line of his neck, down his shoulder. She knew that every gesture of her 
desire for him struck him like a blow, that there was some shudder of 
incredulous anger within him— yet that no gesture would satisfy his greed for 
every evidence of her desire. 

He stood looking down at her naked body, he leaned over, she heard his 
voice— it was more a statement of contemptuous triumph than a question: "You 
want it?" Her answer was more a gasp than a word, her eyes closed, her mouth 
open : "Yes . " 



She knew that what she felt with the skin of her arms was the cloth of his 
shirt, she knew that the lips she felt on her mouth were his, but in the rest 
of her there was no distinction between his being and her own, as there was 
no division between body and spirit. Through all the steps of the years 
behind them, the steps down a course chosen in the courage of a single 
loyalty: their love of existence— chosen in the knowledge that nothing will be 
given, that one must make one's own desire and every shape of its 
fulfillment— through the steps of shaping metal, rails and motors— they had 
moved by the power of the thought that one remakes the earth for one's 
enjoyment, that man's spirit gives meaning to insentient matter by molding it 
to serve one's chosen goal. The course led them to the moment when, in answer 
to the highest of one's values, in an admiration not to be expressed by any 
other form of tribute, one's spirit makes one's body become the tribute, 
recasting it— as proof, as sanction, as reward— into a single sensation of such 
intensity of joy that no other sanction of one's existence is necessary. He 
heard the moan of her breath, she felt the shudder of his body, in the same 
instant . 



CHAPTER IX 
THE SACRED AND THE PROFANE 



She looked at the glowing bands on the skin of her arm, spaced like 
bracelets from her wrist to her shoulder. They were strips of sunlight from 
the Venetian blinds on the window of an unfamiliar room. She saw a bruise 
above her elbow, with dark beads that had been blood. Her arm lay on the 
blanket that covered her body. She was aware of her legs and hips, but the 
rest of her body was only a sense of lightness, as if it were stretched 
restfully across the air in a place that looked like a cage made of sunrays . 

Turning to look at him, she thought: From his aloofness, from his manner 
of glass-enclosed formality, from his pride in never being made to feel 
anything— to this, to Hank Rearden in bed beside her, after hours of a 
violence which they could not name now, not in words or in daylight— but which 
was in their eyes, as they looked at each other, which they wanted to name, 
to stress, to throw at each other's face. 

He saw the face of a young girl, her lips suggesting a smile, as if her 
natural state of relaxation were a state of radiance, a lock of hair falling 
across her cheek to the curve of a naked shoulder, her eyes looking at him as 
if she were ready to accept anything he might wish to say, as she had been 
ready to accept anything he had wished to do. 

He reached over and moved the lock of hair from her cheek, cautiously, as 
if it were fragile. He held it back with his fingertips and looked at her 
face. Then his fingers closed suddenly in her hair and he raised the lock to 
his lips. The way he pressed his mouth to it was tenderness, but the way his 
fingers held it was despair. 

He dropped back on the pillow and lay still, his eyes closed. His face 
seemed young, at peace. Seeing it for a moment without the reins of tension, 
she realized suddenly the extent of the unhappiness he had borne; but it's 
past now, she thought, it's over. 

He got up, not looking at her. His face was blank and closed again. 

He picked up his clothes from the floor and proceeded to dress, standing 
in the middle of the room, half-turned away from her. He acted, not as if she 
wasn't present, but as if it did not matter that she was. His movements, as 
he buttoned his shirt, as he buckled the belt of his slacks, had the rapid 
precision of performing a duty. 

She lay back on the pillow, watching him, enjoying the sight of his figure 
in motion. She liked the gray slacks and shirt— the expert mechanic of the 
John Gait Line, she thought, in the stripes of sunlight and shadow, like a 
convict behind bars. But they were not bars any longer, they were the cracks 
of a wall which the John Gait Line had broken, the advance notice of what 
awaited them outside, beyond the Venetian blinds— she thought of the trip 
back, on the new rail, with the first train from Wyatt Junction— the trip back 
to her office in the Taggart Building and to all the things now open for her 
to win— but she was free to let it wait, she did not want to think of it, she 
was thinking of the first touch of his mouth on hers— she was free to feel it, 
to hold a moment when nothing else was of any concern— she smiled defiantly at 
the strips of sky beyond the blinds. 

"I want you to know this." 

He stood by the bed, dressed, looking down at her. His voice had 
pronounced it evenly, with great clarity and no inflection. She looked up at 
him obediently. He said: "What I feel for you is contempt. But it's nothing, 
compared to the contempt I feel for myself. I don't love you. I've never 
loved anyone. 

I wanted you from the first moment I saw you. I wanted you as one wants a 
whore— for the same reason and purpose. I spent two years damning myself, 
because I thought you were above a desire of this kind. 



You're not. You're as vile an animal as I am. I should loathe my 
discovering it. I don't. Yesterday, I would have killed anyone who'd tell me 
that you were capable of doing what I've had you do. Today, I would give my 
life not to let it be otherwise, not to have you be anything but the bitch 
you are. All the greatness that I saw in you— I would not take it in exchange 
for the obscenity of your talent at an animal's sensation of pleasure. We 
were two great beings, you and I, proud of our strength, weren't we? Well, 
this is all that's left of us— and I want no self-deception about it." 

He spoke slowly, as if lashing himself with his words. There was no sound 
of emotion in his voice, only the lifeless pull of effort; it was not the 
tone of a man's willingness to speak, but the ugly, tortured sound of duty. 

"I held it as my honor that I would never need anyone. I need you. 

It had been my pride that I had always acted on my convictions. I've given 
in to a desire which I despise. It is a desire that has reduced my mind, my 
will, my being, my power to exist into an abject dependence upon you— not even 
upon the Dagny Taggart whom I admired— but upon your body, your hands, your 
mouth and the few seconds of a convulsion of your muscles. I had never broken 
my word. Now I've broken an oath I gave for life. I had never committed an 
act that had to be hidden. Now I am to lie, to sneak, to hide. Whatever I 
wanted, I was free to proclaim it aloud and achieve it in the sight of the 
whole world. 

Now my only desire is one I loathe to name even to myself. But it is my 
only desire. I'm going to have you— I ' d give up everything I own for it, the 
mills, the Metal, the achievement of my whole life. I'm going to have you at 
the price of more than myself: at the price of my self esteem— and I want you 
to know it. I want no pretense, no evasion, no silent indulgence, with the 
nature of our actions left unnamed. I want no pretense about love, value, 
loyalty or respect. I want no shred of honor left to us, to hide behind. I've 
never begged for mercy. I've chosen to do this— and I'll take all the 
consequences, including the full recognition of my choice. It's depravity— and 
I accept it as such— and there is no height of virtue that I wouldn't give up 
for it. Now if you wish to slap my face, go ahead. I wish you would." 

She had listened, sitting up straight, holding the blanket clutched at her 
throat to cover her body. At first, he had seen her eyes growing dark with 
incredulous shock. Then it seemed to him that she was listening with greater 
attentiveness , but seeing more than his face, even though her eyes were fixed 
on his. She looked as if she were studying intently some revelation that had 
never confronted her before. He felt as if some ray of light were growing 
stronger on his face, because he saw its reflection on hers, as she watched 
him— he saw the shock vanishing, then the wonder— he saw her face being 
smoothed into a strange serenity that seemed quiet and glittering at once. 

When he stopped, she burst out laughing. 

The shock to him was that he heard no anger in her laughter. She laughed 
simply, easily, in joyous amusement, in release, not as one laughs at the 
solution of a problem, but at the discovery that no problem had ever existed. 

She threw the blanket off with a stressed, deliberate sweep of her arm. 

She stood up. She saw her clothes on the floor and kicked them aside. 

She stood facing him, naked. She said: "I want you, Hank. I'm much more of 
an animal than you think. I wanted you from the first moment I saw you— and 
the only thing I'm ashamed of is that I did not know it. I did not know why, 
for two years, the brightest moments I found were the ones in your office, 
where I could lift my head to look up at you. I did not know the nature of 
what I felt in your presence, nor the reason. I know it now. That is all I 
want, Hank. I want you in my bed— and you are free of me for all the rest of 
your time. There's nothing you'll have to pretend— don ' t think of me, don't 
feel, don't care— I do not want your mind, your will, your being or your soul, 
so long as it's to me that you will come for that lowest one of your desires. 



I am an animal who wants nothing but that sensation of pleasure which you 
despise--but I want it from you. You'd give up any height of virtue for it, 
while I— I haven't any to give up. There's none I seek or wish to reach. I am 
so low that I would exchange the greatest sight of beauty in the world for 
the sight of your figure in the cab of a railroad engine. And seeing it, I 
would not be able to see it indifferently. You don't have to fear that you're 
now dependent upon me. It's I who will depend on any whim of yours. You'll 
have me any time you wish, anywhere, on any. terms. Did you call it the 
obscenity of my talent? It's such that it gives you a safer hold on me than 
on any other property you own. You may dispose of me as you please— I'm not 
afraid to admit it— L have nothing to protect from you and nothing to reserve. 
You think that this is a threat to your achievement, but it is not to mine. I 
will sit at my desk, and work, and when the things around me get hard to 
bear, I will think that for my reward I will be in your bed that night. Did 
you call it depravity? I am much more depraved than you are: you hold it as 
your guilt, and I— as my pride. I'm more proud of it than of anything I've 
done, more proud than of building the Line. 

If I'm asked to name my proudest attainment, I will say: I have slept with 
Hank Rearden. I had earned it.'l 

When he threw her down on the bed, their bodies met like the two sounds 
that broke against each other in the air of the room: the sound of his 
tortured moan and of her laughter. 

The rain was invisible in the darkness of the streets, but it hung like 
the sparkling fringe of a lampshade under the corner light. Fumbling in his 
pockets, James Taggart discovered that he had lost his handkerchief. 

He swore half-aloud, with resentful malice, as if the loss, the rain and 
his head cold were someone's personal conspiracy against him. 

There was a thin gruel of mud on the pavements; he felt a gluey suction 
under his shoe soles and a chill slipping down past his collar. He did not 
want to walk or to stop. He had no place to go. 

Leaving his office, after the meeting of the Board of Directors, he had 
realized suddenly that there were no other appointments, that he had a long 
evening ahead and no one to help him kill it. The front pages of the 
newspapers were screaming of the triumph of the John Gait Line, as the radios 
had screamed it yesterday and all through the night. The name of Taggart 
Transcontinental was stretched in headlines across the continent, like its 
track, and he had smiled in answer to the congratulations. He had smiled, 
seated at the bead of the long table, at the Board meeting, while the 
Directors spoke about the soaring rise of the Taggart stock on the Exchange, 
while they cautiously asked to see his written agreement with his sister— just 
in case, they said— and commented that it was fine, it was hole proof, there 
was no doubt but that she would have to turn the Line over to Taggart 
Transcontinental at once, they spoke about their brilliant future and the 
debt of gratitude which the company owed to James Taggart. 

He had sat through the meeting, wishing it were over with, so that he 
could go home. Then he had stepped out into the street and realized that home 
was the one place where he dared not go tonight. He could not be alone, not 
in the next few hours, yet there was nobody to call. 

He did not want to see people. He kept seeing the eyes of the men of the 
Board when they spoke about his greatness: a sly, filmy look that held 
contempt for him and, more terrif yingly, for themselves. 

He walked, head down, a needle of rain pricking the skin of his neck once 
in a while. He looked away whenever he passed a newsstand. The papers seemed 
to shriek at him the name of the John Gait Line, and another name which he 
did not want to hear: Ragnar Danneskjold. A ship bound for the People's State 
of Norway with an Emergency Gift cargo of machine tools had been seized by 
Ragnar Danneskjold last night. That story disturbed him in some personal 



manner which he could not explain. The feeling seemed to have some quality in 
common with the things he felt about the John Gait Line. 

It's because he had a cold, he thought; he wouldn't feel this way if he 
didn't have a cold; a man couldn't be expected to be in top form when he had 
a cold— he couldn't help it— what did they expect him to do tonight, sing and 
dance?— he snapped the question angrily at the unknown judges of his 
unwitnessed mood. He fumbled for his handkerchief again, cursed and decided 
that he'd better stop somewhere to buy some paper tissues. 

Across the square of what had once been a busy neighborhood, he saw the 
lighted windows of a dime store, still open hopefully at this late hour. 
There's another one that will go out of business pretty soon, he thought as 
he crossed the square; the thought gave him pleasure. 

There were glaring lights inside, a few tired salesgirls among a spread of 
deserted counters, and the screaming of a phonograph record being played for 
a lone, listless customer in a corner. The music swallowed the sharp edges of 
Taggart's voice: he asked for paper tissues in a tone which implied that the 
salesgirl was responsible for his cold. The girl turned to the counter behind 
her, but turned back once to glance swiftly at his face. She took a packet, 
but stopped, hesitating, studying him with peculiar curiosity. 

"Are you James Taggart?" she asked. 

"Yes!" he snapped. "Why?" 

"Oh ! " 

She gasped like a child at a burst of firecrackers; she was looking at him 
with a glance which he had thought to be reserved only for movie stars. 

"I saw your picture in the paper this morning, Mr. Taggart," she said very 
rapidly, a faint flush appearing on her face and vanishing. "It said what a 
great achievement it was and how it was really you who had done it all, only 
you didn't want it to be known." 

"Oh," said Taggart. He was smiling. 

"You look just like your picture," she said in immense astonishment, and 
added, "Imagine you walking in here like this, in person!" 
"Shouldn't I?" His tone was amused. 

"I mean, everybody's talking about it, the whole country, and you're the 
man who did it— and here you are! I've never seen an important person before. 
I've never been so close to anything important, I mean to any newspaper 
news . " 

He had never had the experience of seeing his presence give color to a 
place he entered: the girl looked as if she was not tired any longer, as if 
the dime store had become a scene of drama and wonder. 

"Mr. Taggart, is it true, what they said about you in the paper?" 

"What did they say?" 

"About your secret." 

"What secret?" 

"Well, they said that when everybody was fighting about your bridge, 
whether it would stand or not, you didn't argue with them, you just went 
ahead, because you knew it would stand, when nobody else was sure of it— so 
the Line was a Taggart project and you were the guiding spirit behind the 
scenes, but you kept it secret, because you didn't care whether you got 
credit for it or not." 

He had seen the mimeographed release of his Public Relations Department. 
"Yes," he said, "it's true." The way she looked at him made him feel as if it 
were . 

"It was wonderful of you, Mr. Taggart." 

"Do you always remember what you read in the newspapers, so well, in such 
detail?" 

"Why, yes, I guess so— all the interesting things. The big things. I like 
to read about them. Nothing big ever happens to me." 



She said it gaily, without self-pity. There was a young, determined 
brusqueness in her voice and movements. She had a head of reddish brown 
curls, wide-set eyes, a few freckles on the bridge of an upturned nose. He 
thought that one would call her face attractive if one ever noticed it, but 
there was no particular reason to notice it. It was a common little face, 
except for a look of alertness, of eager interest, a look that expected the 
world to contain an exciting secret behind every corner. 

"Mr. Taggart, how does it feel to be a great man?" 

"How does it feel to be a little girl?" 

She laughed. "Why, wonderful." 

"Then you're better off than I am." 

"Oh, how can you say such a—" 

"Maybe you're lucky if you don't have anything to do with the big events 
in the newspapers. Big. What do you call big, anyway?" 
"Why . . . important." 
"What's important?" 

"You're the one who ought to tell me that, Mr. Taggart." 
"Nothing's important." 

She looked at him incredulously. "You, of all people, saying that tonight 
of all nights!" 

"1 don't feel wonderful at all, if that's what you want to know. I've 
never felt less wonderful in my life." 

He was astonished to see her studying his face with a look of concern such 
as no one had ever granted him. "You're worn out, Mr. Taggart," 

she said earnestly. "Tell them to go to hell." 

"Whom?" 

"Whoever 's getting you down. It isn't right," 
"What isn't?" 

"That you should feel this way. You've had a tough time, but you've licked 
them all, so you ought to enjoy yourself now. You've earned it." 
"And how do you propose that I enjoy myself?" 

"Oh, I don't know. But I thought you'd be having a celebration tonight, a 
party with all the big shots, and champagne, and things given to you, like 
keys to cities, a real swank party like that— instead of walking around all by 
yourself, shopping for paper handkerchiefs, of all fool things!" 

"You give me those handkerchiefs, before you forget them altogether," he 
said, handing her a dime. "And as to the swank party, did it occur to you 
that I might not want to see anybody tonight?" 

She considered it earnestly. "No," she said, "I hadn't thought of it. 

But I can see why you wouldn't." 

"Why?" It was a question to which he bad no answer. 

"Nobody's really good enough for you, Mr. Taggart," she answered very 
simply, not as flattery, but as a matter of fact. 
"Is that what you think?" 

"I don't think I like people very much, Mr. Taggart. Not most of them." 
"I don't either. Not any of them." 

"I thought a man like you— you wouldn't know how mean they can be and how 
they try to step on you and ride on your back, if you let them. I thought the 
big men in the world could get away from them and not have to be flea-bait 
all of the time, but maybe I was wrong." 

"What do you mean, flea-bait?" 

"Oh, it's just something I tell myself when things get tough— that I've got 
to beat my way out to where I won't feel like I'm flea-bitten all the time by 
all kinds of lousiness— but maybe it's the same anywhere, only the fleas get 
bigger . " 

"Much bigger." 



She remained silent, as if considering something. "It's funny," she said 
sadly to some thought of her own. 
"What's funny?" 

"I read a book once where it said that great men are always unhappy, and 
the greater— the unhappier. It didn't make sense to me. But maybe it's true." 
"It's much truer than you think." 
She looked away, her face disturbed. 

"Why do you worry so much about the great men?" he asked. "What are you, a 
hero worshipper of some kind?" 

She turned to look at him and he saw the light of an inner smile, while 
her face remained solemnly grave; it was the most eloquently personal glance 
he had ever seen directed at himself, while she answered in a quiet, 
impersonal voice, "Mr. Taggart, what else is there to look up to?" 

A screeching sound, neither quite bell nor buzzer, rang out suddenly and 
went on ringing with nerve-grating insistence. 

She jerked her head, as if awakening at the scream of an alarm clock, then 
sighed. "That's closing time, Mr. Taggart," she said regretfully. 

"Go get your hat— I'll wait for you outside," he said. 

She stared at him, as if among all of life's possibilities this was one 
she had never held as conceivable. 
"No kidding?" she whispered. 
"No kidding . " 

She whirled around and ran like a streak to the door of the employeesl 
quarters, forgetting her counter, her duties and all feminine concern 
about never showing eagerness in accepting a man's invitation. 

He stood looking after her for a moment, his eyes narrowed. He did not 
name to himself the nature of his own feeling— never to identify his emotions 
was the only steadfast rule of his life; he merely felt it— and this 
particular feeling was pleasurable, which was the only identification he 
cared to know. But the feeling was the product of a thought he would not 
utter. He had often met girls of the lower classes, who had put on a brash 
little act, pretending to look up to him, spilling crude flattery for an 
obvious purpose; he had neither liked nor resented them; he had found a bored 
amusement in their company and he had granted them the status of his equals 
in a game he considered natural to both players involved. This girl was 
different. The unuttered words in his mind were: The damn little fool means 
it. 

That he waited for her impatiently, when he stood in the rain on the 
sidewalk, that she was the one person he needed tonight, did not disturb him 
or strike him as a contradiction. He did not name the nature of his need. The 
unnamed and the unuttered could not clash into a contradiction. 

When she came out, he noted the peculiar combination of her shyness and of 
her head held high. She wore an ugly raincoat, made worse by a gob of cheap 
jewelry on the lapel, and a small hat of plush flowers planted defiantly 
among her curls. Strangely, the lift of her head made the apparel seem 
attractive; it stressed how well she wore even the things she wore. 

"Want to come to my place and have a drink with me?" he asked. 

She nodded silently, solemnly, as if not trusting herself to find the 
right words of acceptance. Then she said, not looking at him, as if stating 
it to herself, "You didn't want to see anybody tonight, but you want o see 
me. . . "He had never heard so solemn a tone of pride in anyone's voice. 

She was silent, when she sat beside him in the taxicab. She looked up at 
the skyscrapers they passed. After a while, she said, "I heard that things 
like this happened in New York, but I never thought they'd happen to me." 

"Where do you come from?" 

"Buffalo. " 

"Got any family?" 



She hesitated. "I guess so. In Buffalo." 
"What do you mean, you guess so?" 
"I walked out on them." 
"Why?" 

"I thought that if I ever was to amount to anything, I had to get away 
from them, clean away." 
"Why? What happened?" 

"Nothing happened. And nothing was ever going to happen. That's what I 
couldn't stand." 

"What do you mean?" 

"Well, they . . . well, I guess I ought to tell you the truth, Mr. 
Taggart . My old man's never been any good, and Ma didn't care whether he was 
or not, and I got sick of it always turning out that I was the only one of 
the seven of us that kept a job, and the rest of them always being out of 
luck, one way or another. I thought if I didn't get out, it would get me— I ' d 
rot all the way through, like the rest of them. So I bought a railroad ticket 
one day and left. Didn't say good-bye. They didn't even know I was going." 
She gave a soft, startled little laugh at a sudden thought. "Mr. Taggart," 
she said, "it was a Taggart train." 

"When did you come here?" 

"Six months ago." 

"And you're all alone?" 

"Yes," she said happily. 

"What was it you wanted to do?" 

"Well, you know— make something of myself, get somewhere." 
"Where?" 

"Oh, I don't know, but . . . but people do things in the world. 1 

saw pictures of New York and I thought"— she pointed at the giant buildings 
beyond the streaks of rain on the cab window— "I thought, somebody built those 
buildings— he didn't just sit and whine that the kitchen was filthy and the 
roof leaking and the plumbing clogged and it's a goddamn world and . . .Mr. 
Taggart"— she jerked her head in a shudder and looked straight at him— "we were 
stinking poor and not giving a damn about it. That's what I couldn't take- 
that they didn't really give a damn. Not enough to lift a finger. Not enough 
to empty the garbage pail. And the woman next door saying it was my duty to 
help them, saying it made no difference what became of me or of her or of any 
of us, because what could anybody do anyway!" Beyond the bright look of her 
eyes, he saw something within her that was hurt and hard. 

"I don't want to talk about them," she said. "Not with you. This— my 
meeting you, I mean— that ' s what they couldn't have. That's what I'm not going 
to share with them. It's mine, not theirs." 

"How old are you?" he asked. 

"Nineteen . " 

When he looked at her in the lights of his living room, he thought that 
she'd have a good figure if she'd eat a few meals; she seemed too thin for 
the height and structure of her bones. She wore a tight, shabby little black 
dress, which she had tried to camouflage by the gaudy plastic bracelets 
tinkling on her wrist. She stood looking at his room as if it were a museum 
where she must touch nothing and reverently memorize everything. 

"What's your name?" he asked. 

"Cherryl Brooks." 

"Well, sit down." 

He mixed the drinks in silence, while she waited obediently, sitting on 
the edge of an armchair. When he handed her a glass, she swallowed dutifully 
a few times, then held the glass clutched in her hand. He knew that she did 
not taste what she was drinking, did not notice it, had no time to care. 



He took a gulp of his drink and put the glass down with irritation: he did 
not feel like drinking, either. He paced the room sullenly, knowing that her 
eyes followed him, enjoying the knowledge, enjoying the sense of tremendous 
significance which his movements, his cuff links, his shoelaces, his 
lampshades and ashtrays acquired in that gentle, unquestioning glance. 

"Mr. Taggart, what is it that makes you so unhappy?" 

"Why should you care whether I am or not?" 

"Because . . . well, if you haven't the right to be happy and proud, who 
has?" 

"That's what I want to know— who has?" He turned to her abruptly, the words 
exploding as if a safety fuse had blown. "He didn't invent iron ore and blast 
furnaces, did he?" 

"Who?" 

"Rearden. He didn't invent smelting and chemistry and air compression. He 
couldn't have invented his Metal but for thousands and thousands of other 
people. His Metal! Why does he think it's his? Why does he think it's his 
invention? Everybody uses the work of everybody else. 

Nobody ever invents anything." 

She said, puzzled, "But the iron ore and all those other things were there 
all the time. Why didn't anybody else make that Metal, but Mr. 
Rearden did?" 

"He didn't do it for any noble purpose, he did it just for his own profit, 
he's never done anything for any other reason." 

"What's wrong with that, Mr. Taggart?" Then she laughed softly, as if at 
the sudden solution of a riddle. "That's nonsense, Mr. Taggart. You don't 
mean it. You know that Mr. Rearden has earned all his profits, and so have 
you. You're saying those things just to be modest, when everybody knows what 
a great job you people have done— you and Mr. Rearden and your sister, who 
must be such a wonderful person!" 

"Yeah? That's what you think. She's a hard, insensitive woman who spends 
her life building tracks and bridges, not for any great ideal, but only 
because that's what she enjoys doing. If she enjoys it, what is there to 
admire about her doing it? I'm not so sure it was great— building that Line 
for all those prosperous industrialists in Colorado, when there are so many 
poor people in blighted areas who need transportation." 

"But, Mr. Taggart, it was you who fought to build that Line." 

"Yes, because it was my duty— to the company and the stockholders and our 
employees. But don't expect me to enjoy it. I'm not so sure it was great- 
inventing this complex new Metal, when so many nations are in need of plain 
iron— why, do you know that the People's State of China hasn't even got enough 
nails to put wooden roofs over people's heads?" 

"But . . . but I don't see that that's your fault." 

"Somebody should attend to it. Somebody with the vision to see beyond his 
own pocketbook. No sensitive person these days— when there's so much suffering 
around us— would devote ten years of his life to splashing about with a lot of 
trick metals. You think it's great? Well, it's not any kind of superior 
ability, but just a hide that you couldn't pierce if you poured a ton of his 
own steel over his head! There are many people of much greater ability in the 
world, but you don't read about them in the headlines and you don't run to 
gape at them at grade crossings— because they can't invent non-collapsible 
bridges at a time when the suffering of mankind weighs on their spirit!" 

She was looking at him silently, respectfully, her joyous eagerness toned 
down, her eyes subdued. He felt better. 

He picked up his drink, took a gulp, and chuckled abruptly at a sudden 
recollection . 

"It was funny, though, " he said, his tone easier, livelier, the tone of a 
confidence to a pal. "You should have seen Orren Boyle yesterday, when the 



first flash came through on the radio from Wyatt Junction! He turned green- 
but I mean, green, the color of a fish that's been lying around too long! Do 
you know what he did last night, by way of taking the bad news? Hired himself 
a suite at the Valhalla Hotel— and you know what that is— and the last I heard, 
he was still there today, drinking himself under the table and the beds, with 
a few choice friends of his and half the female population of upper Amsterdam 
Avenue ! " 

"Who is Mr. Boyle?" she asked, stupefied. 

"Oh, a fat slob that's inclined to overreach himself. A smart guy who gets 
too smart at times. You should have seen his face yesterday! I got a kick out 
of that. That— and Dr. Floyd Ferris. That smoothy didn't like it a bit, oh not 
a bit!— the elegant Dr. Ferris of the State Science Institute, the servant of 
the people, with the patent-leather vocabulary— but he carried it off pretty 
well, I must say, only you could see him squirming in every paragraph— I mean, 
that interview he gave out this morning, where he said, 'The country gave 
Rearden that Metal, now we expect him to give the country something in 
return.' That was pretty nifty, considering who's been riding on the gravy 
train and . . . well, considering. That was better than Bertram Scudder— Mr. 
Scudder couldn't think of anything but 'No comment, ' when his fellow 
gentlemen of the press asked him to voice his sentiments. 'No comment ' —from 
Bertram Scudder who's never been known to shut his trap from the day he was 
born, about anything you ask him or don't ask, Abyssinian poetry or the state 
of the ladies' rest rooms in the textile industry! And Dr. Pritchett, the old 
fool, is going around saying that he knows for certain that Rearden didn't 
invent that Metal— because he was told, by an unnamed reliable source, that 
Rearden stole the formula from a penniless inventor whom he murdered!" 

He was chuckling happily. She was listening as to a lecture on higher 
mathematics, grasping nothing, not even the style of the language, a style 
which made the mystery greater, because she was certain that it did not mean- 
coming from him— what it would have meant anywhere else. 

He refilled his glass and drained it, but his gaiety vanished abruptly. 

He slumped into an armchair, facing her, looking up at her from under his 
bald forehead, his eyes blurred. 

"She's coming back tomorrow," he said, with a sound like a chuckle devoid 
of amusement. 

"Who?" 

"My sister. My dear sister. Oh, she'll think she's great, won't she?" 
"You dislike your sister, Mr. Taggart?" He made the same sound; its 
meaning was so eloquent that she needed no other answer. "Why?" she asked. 
"Because she thinks she's so good. What right has she to think it? 
What right has anybody to think he's good? Nobody's any good." 
"You don't mean it, Mr. Taggart." 

"I mean, we're only human beings— and what's a human being? A weak, ugly, 
sinful creature, born that way, rotten in his bones— so humility is the one 
virtue he ought to practice. He ought to spend his life on his knees, begging 
to be forgiven for his dirty existence. When a man thinks he's good— that ' s 
when he's rotten. Pride is the worst of all sins, no matter what he's done." 

"But if a man knows that what he's done is good?" 

"Then he ought to apologize for it." 

"To whom?" 

"To those who haven't done it." 
"I ... I don't understand." 

"Of course you don't. It takes years and years of study in the higher 
reaches of the intellect. Have you ever heard of The Metaphysical 
Contradictions of the Universe, by Dr. Simon Pritchett?" She shook her head, 
frightened. "How do you know what's good, anyway? Who knows what's good? Who 
can ever know? There are no absolutes— as Dr. 



Pritchett has proved irrefutably. Nothing is absolute. Everything is a 
matter of opinion. How do you know that that bridge hasn't collapsed? 

You only think it hasn't. How do you know that there's any bridge at all? 

You think that a system of philosophy— such as Dr. Pritchett ' s— is just 
something academic, remote, impractical? But it isn't. Oh, boy, how it 
isn't! " 

"But, Mr. Taggart, the Line you built-" 

"Oh, what's that Line, anyway? It's only a material achievement, is that 
of any importance? Is there any greatness in anything material? 

Only a low animal can gape at that bridge— when there are so many higher 
things in life. But do the higher things ever get recognition? Oh no! Look at 
people. All that hue and cry and front pages about some trick arrangement of 
some scraps of matter. Do they care about any nobler issue? Do they ever give 
front pages to a phenomenon of the spirit? Do they notice or appreciate a 
person of finer sensibility? And you wonder whether it's true that a great 
man is doomed to unhappiness in this depraved world!" He leaned forward, 
staring at her intently. "I'll tell you . . . I'll tell you something . . . 
unhappiness is the hallmark of virtue. If a man is unhappy, really, truly 
unhappy, it means that he is a superior sort of person." 

He saw the puzzled, anxious look of her face. "But, Mr. Taggart, you got 
everything you wanted. Now you have the best railroad in the country, the 
newspapers call you the greatest business executive of the age, they say the 
stock of your company made a fortune for you overnight, you got everything 
you could ask for— aren't you glad of it?" 

In the brief space of his answer, she felt frightened, sensing a sudden 
fear within him. He answered, "No." 

She didn't know why her voice dropped to a whisper. "You'd rather the 
bridge had collapsed?" 

"I haven't said that!" he snapped sharply. Then he shrugged and waved his 
hand in a gesture of contempt. "You don't understand." 

"I'm sorry . . . Oh, I know that I have such an awful lot to learn!" 

"I am talking about a hunger for something much beyond that bridge. 

A hunger that nothing material will ever satisfy." 

"What, Mr. Taggart? What is it you want?" 

"Oh, there you go! The moment you ask, 'What is it?' you're back in the 
crude, material world where everything's got to be tagged and measured. I'm 
speaking of things that can't be named in materialistic words . . . the 
higher realms of the spirit, which man can never reach. . . . 

What's any human achievement, anyway? The earth is only an atom whirling 
in the universe— of what importance is that bridge to the solar system?" 

A sudden, happy look of understanding cleared her eyes. "It's great of 
you, Mr. Taggart, to think that your own achievement isn't good enough for 
you. I guess no matter how far you've gone, you want to go still farther. 
You're ambitious. That's what I admire most: ambition. I mean, doing things, 
not stopping and giving up, but doing. I understand, Mr. Taggart . . . even 
if I don't understand all the big thoughts." 

"You'll learn." 

"Oh, I'll work very hard to learn!" 

Her glance of admiration had not changed. He walked across the room, 
moving in that glance as in a gentle spotlight. He went to refill his glass. 
A mirror hung in the niche behind the portable bar. He caught a glimpse of 
his own figure: the tall body distorted by a sloppy, sagging posture, as if 
in deliberate negation of human grace, the thinning hair, the soft, sullen 
mouth. It struck him suddenly that she did not see him at all: what she saw 
was the heroic figure of a builder, with proudly straight shoulders and wind- 
blown hair. He chuckled aloud, feeling that this was a good joke on her, 



feeling dimly a satisfaction that resembled a sense of victory: the 
superiority of having put something over on her. 

Sipping his drink, he glanced at the door of his bedroom and thought of 
the usual ending for an adventure of this kind. He thought that it would be 
easy: the girl was too awed to resist. He saw the reddish-bronze sparkle of 
her hair— as she sat, head bent, under a light— and a wedge of smooth, glowing 
skin on her shoulder. He looked away. Why bother? 

—he thought . 

The hint of desire that he felt, was no more than a sense of physical 
discomfort. The sharpest impulse in his mind, nagging him to action, was not 
the thought of the girl, but of all the men who would not pass up an 
opportunity of this kind. He admitted to himself that she was a much better 
person than Betty Pope, perhaps the best person ever offered to him. The 
admission left him indifferent. He felt no more than he had felt for Betty 
Pope. He felt nothing. The prospect of experiencing pleasure was not worth 
the effort; he had no desire to experience pleasure. 

"It's getting late," he said. "Where do you live? Let me give you another 
drink and then I'll take you home." 

When he said good-bye to her at the door of a miserable rooming house in a 
slum neighborhood, she hesitated, fighting not to ask a question which she 
desperately wished to ask him, "Will I . . . " she began, and stopped. 

"What?" 

"No, nothing, nothing!" 

He knew that the question was: "Will I see you again?" It gave him 
pleasure not to answer, even though he knew that she would. 

She glanced up at him once more, as if it were perhaps for the last time, 
then said earnestly, her voice low, "Mr. Taggart, I'm very grateful to you, 
because you ... I mean, any other man would have tried to ... I mean, 
that's all he'd want, but you're so much better than that, oh, so much 
better! " 

He leaned closer to her with a faint, interested smile. "Would you have?" 
he asked. 

She drew back from him, in sudden terror at her own words. "Oh, I didn't 
mean it that way!" she gasped. "Oh God, I wasn't hinting or . . . 

or . . ." She blushed furiously, whirled around and ran, vanishing up the 
long, steep stairs of the rooming house. 

He stood on the sidewalk, feeling an odd, heavy, foggy sense of 
satisfaction: feeling as if he had committed an act of virtue— and as if he 
had taken his revenge upon every person who had stood cheering along the 
three-hundred-mile track of the John Gait Line. 

When their train reached Philadelphia, Rearden left her without a word, as 
if the nights of their return journey deserved no acknowledgment in the 
daylight reality of crowded station platforms and moving engines, the reality 
he respected. She went on to New York, alone. But late that evening, the 
doorbell of her apartment rang and Dagny knew that she had expected it. 

He said nothing when he entered, he looked at her, making his silent 
presence more intimate a greeting than words. There was the faint suggestion 
of a contemptuous smile in his face, at once admitting and mocking his 
knowledge of her hours of impatience and his own. He stood in the middle of 
her living room, looking slowly around him; this was her apartment, the one 
place in the city that had been the focus of two years of his torment, as the 
place he could not think about and did, the place he could not enter— and was 
now entering with the casual, unannounced right of an owner. He sat down in 
an armchair, stretching his legs forward— and she stood before him, almost as 
if she needed his permission to sit down and it gave her pleasure to wait. 

"Shall I tell you that you did a magnificent job, building that Line?" 



he asked. She glanced at him in astonishment; he had never paid her open 
compliments of that kind; the admiration in his voice was genuine, but the 
hint of mockery remained in his face, and she felt as if he were speaking to 
some purpose which she could not guess. "I've spent all day answering 
questions about you — and about the Line, the Metal and the future. That, and 
counting the orders for the Metal. 

They're coming in at the rate of thousands of tons an hour. When was it, 
nine months ago?— I couldn't get a single answer anywhere. Today, I had to cut 
off my phone, not to listen to all the people who wanted to speak to me 
personally about their urgent need of Rearden Metal. 

What did you do today?" 

"I don't know. Tried to listen to Eddie's reports— tried to get away from 
people— tried to find the rolling stock to put more trains on the John Gait 
Line, because the schedule I'd planned won't be enough for the business 
that's piled up in just three days." 

"A great many people wanted to see you today, didn't they?" 

"Why. yes." 

"They'd have given anything just for a word with you, wouldn't they?" ' 
"I ... I suppose so." 

"The reporters kept asking me what you were like. A young boy from a local 
sheet kept saying that you were a great woman. He said he'd be afraid to 
speak to you, if he ever had the chance. He's right. That future that they're 
all talking and trembling about— it will be as you made it, because you had 
the courage none of them could conceive of. 

All the roads to wealth that they're scrambling for now, it's your 
strength that broke them open. The strength to stand against everyone. 

The strength to recognize no will but your own." 

She caught the sinking gasp of her breath: she knew his purpose. She stood 
straight, her arms at her sides, her face austere, as if in unflinching 
endurance; she stood under the praise as under a lashing of insults. 

"They kept asking you questions, too, didn't they?" He spoke intently, 
leaning forward. "And they looked at you with admiration. 

They looked, as if you stood on a mountain peak and they could only take 
their hats off to you across the great distance. Didn't they?" 

"Yes," she whispered. 

"They looked as if they knew that one may not approach you or speak in 
your presence or touch a fold of your dress. They knew it and it's true. They 
looked at you with respect, didn't they? They looked up to you?" 

He seized her arm, threw her down on her knees, twisting her body against 
his legs, and bent down to kiss her mouth. She laughed soundlessly, her 
laughter mocking, but her eyes half-closed, veiled with pleasure. 

Hours later, when they lay in bed together, his hand moving over her body, 
he asked suddenly, throwing her back against the curve of his arm, bending 
over her— and she knew, by the intensity of his face, by the sound of a gasp 
somewhere in the quality of his voice, even though his voice was low and 
steady, that the question broke out of him as if it were worn by the hours of 
torture he had spent with it: "Who were the other men that had you?" 

He looked at her as if the question were a sight visualized in every 
detail, a sight he loathed, but would not abandon; she heard the contempt in 
his voice, the hatred, the suffering— and an odd eagerness that did not 
pertain to torture; he had asked the question, holding her body tight against 
him. 

She answered evenly, but he saw a dangerous flicker in her eyes, as of a 
warning that she understood him too well. "There was only one other, Hank." 
"When?" 

"When I was seventeen. '1 
"Did it last?" 



"For some years." 
"Who was he?" 

She drew back, lying against his arm; he leaned closer, his face taut; she 
held his eyes. "I won't answer you." 
"Did you love him?" 
"I won't answer." 

"Did you like sleeping with him?" 
"Yes ! " 

The laughter in her eyes made it sound like a slap across his face, the 
laughter of her knowledge that this was the answer he dreaded and wanted. 

He twisted her arms behind her, holding her helpless, her breasts pressed 
against him; she felt the pain ripping through her shoulders, she heard the 
anger in his words and the huskiness of pleasure in his voice: "Who was he?" 

She did not answer, she looked at him, her eyes dark and oddly brilliant, 
and he saw that the shape of her mouth, distorted by pain, was the shape of a 
mocking smile. 

He felt it change to a shape of surrender, under the touch of his lips. 

He held her body as if the violence and the despair of the way he took her 
could wipe his unknown rival out of existence, out of her past, and more: as 
if it could transform any part of her, even the rival, into an instrument of 
his pleasure. He knew, by the eagerness of her movement as her arms seized 
him, that this was the way she wanted to be taken. 

-k -k -k 

The silhouette of a conveyor belt moved against the strips of fire in the 
sky, raising coal to the top of a distant tower, as if an inexhaustible 
number of small black buckets rode out of the earth in a diagonal line across 
the sunset. The harsh, distant clatter kept going through the rattle of the 
chains which a young man in blue overalls was fastening over the machinery, 
securing it to the flatcars lined on the siding of the Quinn Ball Bearing 
Company of Connecticut. 

Mr. Mowen, of the Amalgamated Switch and Signal Company across the street, 
stood by, watching. He had stopped to watch, on his way home from his own 
plant. He wore a light overcoat stretched over his short, paunchy figure, and 
a derby hat over his graying, blondish head. 

There was a first touch of September chill in the air. All the gates of 
the Quinn plant buildings stood wide open, while men and cranes moved the 
machinery out; like taking the vital organs and leaving a carcass, thought 
Mr. Mowen. 

"Another one?" asked Mr. Mowen, jerking his thumb at the plant, even 
though he knew the answer. 

"Huh?" asked the young man, who had not noticed him standing there. 
"Another company moving to Colorado?" 
"Uh-huh. " 

"It's the third one from Connecticut in the last two weeks," said Mr. 

Mowen. "And when you look at what's happening in New Jersey, Rhode Island, 
Massachusetts and all along the Atlantic coast . . ." 

The young man was not looking and did not seem to listen. "It's like a 
leaking faucet," said Mr. Mowen, "and all the water's running out to 
Colorado. All the money." The young man flung the chain across and followed 
it deftly, climbing over the big shape covered with canvas. 

"You'd think people would have some feeling for their native state, some 
loyalty . . . But they're running away. I don't know what's happening to 
people . " 

"It's the Bill," said the young man. 
"What Bill?" 



"The Equalization of Opportunity Bill." 
"How do you mean?" 

"I hear Mr. Quinn was making plans a year ago to open a branch in 
Colorado. The Bill knocked that out cold. So now he's made up his mind to 
move there, lock, stock and barrel." 

"I don't see where that makes it right. The Bill was necessary. It's a 
rotten shame— old firms that have been here for generations . . . 

There ought to be a law . . . " 

The young man worked swiftly, competently, as if he enjoyed it. Behind 
him. the conveyor belt kept rising and clattering against the sky. 

Four distant smokestacks stood like flagpoles, with coils of smoke weaving 
slowly about them, like long banners at half-mast in the reddish glow of the 
evening . 

Mr. Mowen had lived with every smokestack of that skyline since the days 
of his father and grandfather. He had seen the conveyor belt from his office 
window for thirty years. That the Quinn Ball Bearing Company should vanish 
from across the street had seemed inconceivable; he had known about Quinn 's 
decision and had not believed it; or rather, he had believed it as he 
believed any words he heard or spoke: as sounds that bore no fixed relation 
to physical reality. Now he knew that it was real. He stood by the flatcars 
on the siding as if he still had a chance to stop them. 

"It isn't right," he said; he was speaking to the skyline at large, but 
the young man above was the only part of it that could hear him. 

"That's not the way it was in my father's time. I'm not a big shot. I 
don't want to fight anybody. What's the matter with the world?" There was no 
answer, "Now you, for instance— are they taking you along to Colorado?" 

"Me? No. I don't work here. I'm just transient labor. Just picked up this 
job helping to lug the stuff out." 

"Well, where are you going to go when they move away?" 

"Haven't any idea." 

"What are you going to do, if more of them move out?" 
"Wait and see." 

Mr. Mowen glanced up dubiously: he could not tell whether the answer was 
intended to apply to him or to the young man. But the young man's attention 
was fixed on his task; he was not looking down. 

He moved on, to the shrouded shapes on the next flatcar, and Mr. 

Mowen followed, looking up at him, pleading with something up in space: 
"I've got rights, haven't I? I was born here. I expected the old companies to 
be here when I grew up. I expected to run the plant like my father did. A man 
is part of his community, he's got a right to count on it, hasn't he? . . . 
Something ought to be done about it." 

"About what?" 

"Oh, I know, you think it's great, don't you?— that Taggart boom and 
Rearden Metal and the gold rush to Colorado and the drunken spree out there, 
with Wyatt and his bunch expanding their production like kettles boiling 
over! Everybody thinks it's great— that ' s all you hear anywhere you go— people 
are slap-happy, making plans like six-year olds on a vacation— you ' d think it 
was a national honeymoon of some kind or a permanent Fourth of July!" 

The young man said nothing. 

"Well, I don't think so," said Mr. Mowen. He lowered his voice. 'The 
newspapers don't say so, either— mind you that— the newspapers aren't saying 
anything . " 

Mr. Mowen heard no answer, only the clanking of the chains. 

"Why are they all running to Colorado?" he asked. "What have they got down 
there that we haven't got?" 

The young man grinned. "Maybe it's something you've got that they haven't 
got. " 



"What?" The young man did not answer. "I don't see it. It's a backward, 
primitive, unenlightened place. They don't even have a modern government. 
It's the worst government in any state. The laziest. It does nothing— outside 
of keeping law courts and a police department. 

It doesn't do anything for the people. It doesn't help anybody. I don't 
see why all our best companies want to run there." 

The young man glanced down at him, but did not answer. 

Mr. Mowen sighed. "Things aren't right," he said. "The Equalization of 
Opportunity Bill was a sound idea. There's got to be a chance for everybody. 
It's a rotten shame if people like Quinn take unfair 

advantage of it. Why didn't he let somebody else start manufacturing ball 
bearings in Colorado? ... I wish the Colorado people would leave us alone. 
That Stockton Foundry out there had no right going into the switch and signal 
business. That's been my business for years, I have the right of seniority, 
it isn't fair, it's dog-eat-dog competition, newcomers shouldn't be allowed 
to muscle in. Where am I going to sell switches and signals? There were two 
big railroads out in Colorado. 

Now the Phoenix-Durango ' s gone, so there's just Taggart Transcontinental 
left. It isn't fair— their forcing Dan Conway out. There's got to be room for 
competition. . . . And I've been waiting six months for an order of steel 
from Orren Boyle— and now he says he can't promise me anything, because 
Rearden Metal has shot his market to hell, there's a run on that Metal, Boyle 
has to retrench. It isn't fair— Rearden being allowed to ruin other people's 
markets that way. . . . And I want to get some Rearden Metal, too, I need it— 
but try and get it! He has a waiting line that would stretch across three 
states— nobody can get a scrap of it, except his old friends, people like 
Wyatt and Danagger and such. It isn't fair. It's discrimination. I'm just as 
good as the next fellow. I'm entitled to my share of that Metal." 

The young man looked up. "I was in Pennsylvania last week," he said. "I 
saw the Rearden mills. There's a place that's busy! They're building four new 
open-hearth furnaces, and they've got six more coming. . . . New furnaces," 
he said, looking off to the south. "Nobody's built a new furnace on the 
Atlantic coast for the last five years. . . ."He stood against the sky, on 
the top of a shrouded motor, looking off at the dusk with a faint smile of 
eagerness and longing, as one looks at the distant vision of one's love. 
"They're busy. . . ."he said. 

Then his smile vanished abruptly; the way he jerked the cru-fin was the 
first break in the smooth competence of his movements: it looked like a jolt 
of anger. 

Mr. Mowen looked at the skyline, at the belts, the wheels, the smoke— the 
smoke that settled heavily, peacefully across the evening air, stretching in 
a long haze all the way to the city of New York somewhere beyond the sunset— 
and he felt reassured by the thought of New York in its ring of sacred fires, 
the ring of smokestacks, gas tanks, cranes and high tension lines. He felt a 
current of power flowing through every grimy structure of his familiar 
street; he liked the figure of the young man above him, there was something 
reassuring in the way he worked, something that blended with the skyline. . . 
. Yet Mr. Mowen wondered why he felt that a crack was growing somewhere, 
eating through the solid, the eternal walls. 

"Something ought to be done," said Mr. Mowen. "A friend of mine went out 
of business last week— the oil business— had a couple of wells down in 
Oklahoma— couldn ' t compete with Ellis Wyatt. It isn't fair. They ought to 
leave the little people a chance. They ought to place a limit on Wyatt ' s 
output. He shouldn't be allowed to produce so much that he'll swamp everybody 
else off the market. ... I got stuck in New York yesterday, had to leave my 
car there and come home on a damn commuters ' 1 local, couldn't get any gas for 



the car, they said there's a shortage of oil in the city. . . . Things aren't 
right. Something ought to be done about it. . . ." 

Looking at the skyline, Mr. Mowen wondered what was the nameless threat to 
it and who was its destroyer. 

"What do you want to do about it?" asked the young man. 

"Who, me?" said Mr. Mowen. "I wouldn't know. I'm not a big shot. 

I can't solve national problems. I just want to make a living. All I know 
is, somebody ought to do something about it. . . . Things aren't right. . . . 
Listen— what ' s your name?" 

"Owen Kellogg." 

"Listen, Kellogg, what do you think is going to happen to the world?" 
"You wouldn't care to know." 

A whistle blew on a distant tower, the night-shift whistle, and Mr. 
Mowen realized that it was getting late. He sighed, buttoning his coat, 
turning to go. 

"Well, things are being done," he said. "Steps are being taken. 
Constructive steps. The Legislature has passed a Bill giving wider powers to 
the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources. They've appointed a 
very able man as Top Co-ordinator . Can't say I've heard of him before, but 
the newspapers said he's a man to be watched. His name is Wesley Mouch." 

Dagny stood at the window of her living room, looking at the city. 

It was late and the lights were like the last sparks left glittering on 
the black remnants of a bonfire. 

She felt at peace, and she wished she could hold her mind still to let her 
own emotions catch up with her, to look at every moment of the month that had 
rushed past her. She had had no time to feel that she was back in her own 
office at Taggart Transcontinental; there had been so much to do that she 
forgot it was a return from exile. She had not noticed what Jim had said on 
her return or whether he had said anything. There had been only one person 
whose reaction she had wanted to know; she had telephoned the Wayne-Falkland 
Hotel; but Senor Francisco d'Anconia, she was told, had gone back to Buenos 
Aires . 

She remembered the moment when she signed her name at the bottom of a long 
legal page; it was the moment that ended the John Gait Line. Now it was the 
Rio Norte Line of Taggart Transcontinental again— except that the men of the 
train crews refused to give up its name. She, too, found it hard to give up; 
she forced herself not to call it "the John Gait, " and wondered why that 
required an effort, and why she felt a faint wrench of sadness. 

One evening, on a sudden impulse, she had turned the corner of the Taggart 
Building, for a last look at the office of John Gait, Inc., in the alley; she 
did not know what she wanted— just to see it, she thought. 

A plank barrier had been raised along the sidewalk: the old building was 
being demolished; it had given up, at last. She had climbed over the planks 
and, by the light of the street lamp that had once thrown a stranger's shadow 
across the pavement, she had looked in through the window of her former 
office. Nothing was left of the ground floor; the partitions had been torn 
down, there were broken pipes hanging from the ceiling and a pile of rubble 
on the floor. There was nothing to see. 

She had asked Rearden whether he had come there one night last spring and 
stood outside her window, fighting his desire to enter. But she had known, 
even before he answered, that he had not. She did not tell him why she asked 
it. She did not know why that memory still disturbed her at times. 

Beyond the window of her living room, the lighted rectangle of the 
calendar hung like a small shipping tag in the black sky. It read: September 
2. She smiled defiantly, remembering the race she had run against its 
changing pages; there were no deadlines now, she thought, no barriers, no 
threats, no limits. 



She heard a key turning in the door of her apartment; this was the sound 
she had waited for, had wanted to hear tonight. 

Rearden came in, as he had come many times, using the key she had given 
him, as sole announcement. He threw his hat and coat down on a chair with a 
gesture that had become familiar; he wore the formal black of dinner clothes. 

"Hello," she said. 

"I'm still waiting for the evening when I won't find you in," he answered, 
"Then you'll have to phone the offices of Taggart Transcontinental." 
"Any evening? Nowhere else?" 
"Jealous, Hank?" 

"No. Curious what it would feel like, to be." 

He stood looking at her across the room, refusing to let himself approach 
her, deliberately prolonging the pleasure of knowing that he could do it 
whenever he wished. She wore the tight gray skirt of an office suit and a 
blouse of transparent white cloth tailored like a man's shirt; the blouse 
flared out above her waistline, stressing the trim flatness of her hips; 
against the glow of a lamp behind her, he could see the slender silhouette of 
her body within the flaring circle of the blouse. 

"How was the banquet?" she asked. 

"Fine. I escaped as soon as I could. Why didn't you come? You were 
invited . " 

"I didn't want to see you in public." 

He glanced at her, as if stressing that he noted the full meaning of her 
answer; then the lines of his face moved to the hint of an amused smile. "You 
missed a lot. The National Council of Metal Industries won't put itself again 
through the ordeal of having me for guest of honor. 

Not if they can help it." 

"What happened?" 

"Nothing. Just a lot of speeches." 
"Was it an ordeal for you?" 

"No . . . Yes, in a way ... I had really wanted to enjoy it." 
"Shall I get you a drink?" 
"Yes, will you?" 

She turned to go. He stopped her, grasping her shoulders from behind; he 
bent her head back and kissed her mouth. When he raised his head, she pulled 
it down again with a demanding gesture of ownership, as if stressing her 
right to do it. Then she stepped away from him. 

"Never mind the drink," he said, "I didn't really want it— except for 
seeing you wait on me." 

"Well, then, let me wait on you." 

"No . " 

He smiled, stretching himself out on the couch, his hands crossed under 
his head. He felt at home; it was the first home he had ever found. 

"You know, the worst part of the banquet was that the only wish of every 
person present was to get it over with," he said. "What I can't understand is 
why they wanted to do it at all. They didn't have to. Certainly not for my 
sake . " 

She picked up a cigarette box, extended it to him, then held the flame of 
a lighter to the tip of his cigarette, in the deliberate manner of waiting on 
him. She smiled in answer to his chuckle, then sat down on the arm of a chair 
across the room. 

"Why did you accept their invitation, Hank?" she asked. "You've always 
refused to join them." 

"I didn't want to refuse a peace offer— when I've beaten them and they know 
it. I'll never join them, but an invitation to appear as a guest of honor- 
well, I thought they were good losers. I thought it was generous of them." 

"Of them?" 



"Are you going to say: of me?" 

"Hank! After all the things they've done to stop you—" 

"I won, didn't I? So I thought . . . You know, I didn't hold it against 
them that they couldn't see the value of the Metal sooner— so long as they saw 
it at last. Every man learns in his own way and time. 

Sure, I knew there was a lot of cowardice there, and envy and hypocrisy, 
but I thought that that was only the surface— now, when I've proved my case, 
when I've proved it so loudly!— I thought their real motive for inviting me 
was their appreciation of the Metal, and—" 

She smiled in the brief space of his pause; she knew the sentence he had 
stopped himself from uttering: " and for that, I would forgive anyone 
anything . " 

"But it wasn't," he said. "And I couldn't figure out what their motive 
was. Dagny, I don't think they had any motive at all. They didn't give that 
banquet to please me, or to gain something from me, or to save face with the 
public. There was no purpose of any kind about it, no meaning. They didn't 
really care when they denounced the Metal— and they don't care now. They're 
not really afraid that I'll drive them all off the market— they don't care 
enough even about that. Do you know what that banquet was like? It's as if 
they'd heard that there are values one is supposed to honor and this is what 
one does to honor them— so they went through the motions, like ghosts pulled 
by some sort of distant echoes from a better age. I ... I couldn't stand 
it. " 

She said, her face tight, "And you don't think you're generous!" 
He glanced up at her; his eyes brightened to a look of amusement. 
"Why do they make you so angry?" 

She said, her voice low to hide the sound of tenderness, "You wanted to 
enjoy it . . . " 

"It probably serves me right. I shouldn't have expected anything. 1 
don't know what it was that I wanted." 
"I do." 

"I've never liked occasions of that sort. I don't see why I expected it to 
be different, this time. . . . You know, I went there feeling almost as if 
the Metal had changed everything, even people." 

"Oh yes, Hank, I know!" 

"Well, it was the wrong place to seek anything. ... Do you remember? You 
said once that celebrations should be only for those who have something to 
celebrate . " 

The dot of her lighted cigarette stopped in mid-air; she sat still. She 
had never spoken to him of that party or of anything related to his home. In 
a moment., she answered quietly, "I remember." 

"1 know what you meant ... I knew it then, too." 

He was looking straight at her. She lowered her eyes. 

He remained silent; when he spoke again, his voice was gay. "The worst 
thing about people is not the insults they hand out, but the compliments. I 
couldn't bear the kind they spouted tonight, particularly when they kept 
saying how much everybody needs me— they, the city, the country and the whole 
world, I guess. Apparently, their idea of the height of glory is to deal with 
people who need them. I can't stand people who need me." He glanced at her. 
"Do you need me?" 

She answered, her voice earnest, "Desperately." 

He laughed. "No. Not the way I meant. You didn't say it the way they do." 
"How did I say it?" 

"Like a trader— who pays for what he wants. They say it like beggars who 
use a tin cup as a claim check." 
"I . . . pay for it, Hank?" 

"Don't look innocent. You know exactly what I mean." 



"Yes," she whispered; she was smiling. 

"Oh, to hell with them!" he said happily, stretching his legs, shifting 
the position of his body on the couch, stressing the luxury of relaxation. 
"I'm no good as a public figure. Anyway, it doesn't matter now. 

We don't have to care what they see or don't see. They'll leave us alone. 
It's clear track ahead. What's the next undertaking, Mr. Vice-President?" 

"A transcontinental track of Rearden Metal." 

"How soon do you want it?" 

"Tomorrow morning. Three years from now is when I'll get it." 
"Think you can do it in three years?" 

"If the John Gait ... if the Rio Norte Line does as well as it's doing 
now . " 

"It's going to do better. That's only the beginning." 

"I have an installment plan made out. As the money comes in, I'm going to 
start tearing up the main track, one division at a time, and replacing it 
with Rearden Metal rail." 

"Okay. Any time you wish to start." 

"I'll keep moving the old rail to the branch lines— they won't last much 
longer, if I don't. In three years, you'll ride on your own Metal into San 
Francisco, if somebody wants to give you a banquet there." 

"In three years, I'll have mills pouring Rearden Metal in Colorado, in 
Michigan and in Idaho. That's my installment plan." 

"Your own mills? Branches?" 

"Uh-huh. " 

"What about the Equalization of Opportunity Bill?" 

"You don't think it's going to exist three years from now, do you? 

We've given them such a demonstration that all that rot is going to be 
swept away. The whole country is with us. Who'll want to stop things now? 
Who'll listen to the bilge? There's a lobby of the better kind of men working 
In Washington right this moment. They're going to get the Equalization Bill 
scrapped at the next session." 

"I . . .1 hope so." 

"I've had a terrible time, these last few weeks, getting the new furnaces 
started, but it's all set now, they're being built, I can sit back and take 
it easy. I can sit at my desk, rake in the money, loaf like a bum, watch the 
orders for the Metal pouring in and play favorites ail over the place. . . . 
Say, what's the first train you've got for Philadelphia tomorrow morning?" 

"Oh, I don't know." 

"You don't? What's the use of an Operating Vice-president? I have to be at 
the mills by seven tomorrow. Got anything running around six?" 
"Five-thirty A.M. is the first one, I think." 

"Will you wake me up in time to make it or would you rather order the 
train held for me?" 
"I'll wake you up." 
"Ok" . 

She sat, watching him as he remained silent. He had looked tired when he 
came in; the lines of exhaustion were gone from his face now. 

"Dagny, " he asked suddenly; his tone had changed, there was some hidden, 
earnest note in his voice, "why didn't you want to see me in public?" 

"I don't want to be part of your . . . official life." 

He did not answer; in a moment, he asked casually, "When did you take a 
vacation last?" 

"I think it was two . . . no, three years ago." 
"What did you do?" 

"Went to the Adirondacks for a month. Came back in a week." 
"I did that five years ago. Only it was Oregon." He lay flat on his back, 
looking at the ceiling. "Dagny, let's take a vacation together. Let's take my 



car and drive away for a few weeks, anywhere, just drive, down the back 
roads, where no one knows us. We'll leave no address, we won't look at a 
newspaper, we won't touch a phone— we won't have any official life at all." 

She got up. She approached him, she stood by the side of the couch, 
looking down at him, the light of the lamp behind her; she did not want him 
to see her face and the effort she was making not to smile. 

"You can take a few weeks off. can't you?" he said. "Things are set and 
going now. It's safe. We won't have another chance in the next three years." 

"All right, Hank," she said, forcing her voice to sound calmly toneless. 

"Will you?" 

"When do you want to start?" 
"Monday morning." 
"All right." 

She turned to step away. He seized her wrist, pulled her down, swung her 
body to lie stretched full-length on top of him, he held her still, 
uncomfortably, as she had fallen, his one hand in her hair, pressing her 
mouth to his, his other hand moving from the shoulder blades under her thin 
blouse to her waist, to her legs. She whispered, "And you say I don't need 
you . . . ! " 

She pulled herself away from him, and stood up, brushing her hair off her 
face. He lay still, looking up at her, his eyes narrowed, the bright flicker 
of some particular interest in his eyes, intent and faintly mocking. She 
glanced down: a strap of her slip had broken, the slip hung diagonally from 
her one shoulder to her side, and he was looking at her breast under the 
transparent film of the blouse. She raised her hand to adjust the strap. He 
slapped her hand down. She smiled, in understanding, in answering mockery. 
She walked slowly, deliberately across the room and leaned against a table, 
facing him, her hands holding the table's edge, her shoulders thrown back. It 
was the contrast he liked— the severity of her clothes and the half-naked 
body, the railroad executive who was a woman he owned. 

He sat up; he sat leaning comfortably across the couch, his legs crossed 
and stretched forward, his hands in his pockets, looking at her with the 
glance of a property appraisal. 

"Did you say you wanted a transcontinental track of Rearden Metal, Mr. 
Vice-President?" he asked. "What if I don't give it to you? I can choose my 
customers now and demand any price I please. If this were a year ago, I would 
have demanded that you sleep with me in exchange." 

"I wish you had." 

"Would you have done it?" 

"Of course . " 

"As a matter of business? As a sale?" 

"If you were the buyer. You would have liked that, wouldn't you?" 
"Would you?" 

"Yes . . ." she whispered. 

He approached her, he grasped her shoulders and pressed his mouth to her 
breast through the thin cloth. 

Then, holding her, he looked at her silently for a long moment. 
"What did you do with that bracelet?" he asked. 

They had never referred to it; she had to let a moment pass to regain the 
steadiness of her voice. "I have it," she answered. 
"I want you to wear it." 

"If anyone guesses, it will be worse for you than for me." 
"Wear it." 

She brought out the bracelet of Rearden Metal. She extended it to him 
without a word, looking straight at him, the green-blue chain glittering 
across her palm. Holding her glance, he clasped the bracelet on her wrist. In 



the moment when the clasp clicked shut under his fingers, she bent her head 
down to them and kissed his hand. 

The earth went flowing under the hood of the car. Uncoiling from among the 
curves of Wisconsin's hills, the highway was the only evidence of human 
labor, a precarious bridge stretched across a sea of brush, weeds and trees. 
The sea rolled softly, in sprays of yellow and orange, with a few red jets 
shooting up on the hillsides, with pools of remnant green in the hollows, 
under a pure blue sky. Among the colors of a picture post card, the car's 
hood looked like the work of a jeweler, with the sun sparkling on its 
chromium steel, and its black enamel reflecting the sky. 

Dagny leaned against the corner of the side window, her legs stretched 
forward; she liked the wide, comfortable space of the car's seat and the 
warmth of the sun on her shoulders; she thought that the countryside was 
beautiful . 

"What I'd like to see," said Rearden, "is a billboard," 

She laughed: he had answered her silent thought. "Selling what and to 
whom? We haven't seen a car or a house for an hour." 

"That's what I don't like about it." He bent forward a little, his hands 
on the wheel; he was frowning. "Look at that road." 

The long strip of concrete was bleached to the powdery gray of bones left 
on a desert, as if sun and snows had eaten away the traces of tires, oil and 
carbon, the lustrous polish of motion. Green weeds rose from the angular 
cracks of the concrete. No one had used the road or repaired it for many 
years; but the cracks were few. 

"It's a good road," said Rearden. "It was built to last. The man who built 
it must have had a good reason for expecting it to carry a heavy traffic in 
the years ahead." 

"Yes ..." 

"I don't like the looks of this." 

"I don't either." Then she smiled. "But think how often we've heard people 
complain that billboards ruin the appearance of the countryside. 

Well, there's the unruined countryside for them to admire." She added, 
"They're the people I hate." 

She did not want to feel the uneasiness which she felt like a thin crack 
under her enjoyment of this day. She had felt that uneasiness at times, in 
the last three weeks, at the sight of the country streaming past the wedge of 
the car's hood. She smiled: it was the hood that had been the immovable point 
in her field of vision, while the earth had gone by, it was the hood that had 
been the center, the focus, the security in a blurred, dissolving world . . . 
the hood before her and Rearden 's hands on the wheel by her side . . . she 
smiled, thinking that she was satisfied to let this be the shape of her 
world . 

After the first week of their wandering, when they had driven at random, 
at the mercy of unknown crossroads, he had said to her one morning as they 
started out, "Dagny, does resting have to be purposeless?" She had laughed, 
answering, "No. What factory do you want to see?" He had smiled— at the guilt 
he did not have to assume, at the explanations he did not have to give— and he 
had answered, "It's an abandoned ore mine around Saginaw Bay, that I've heard 
about. They say it's exhausted." 

They had driven across Michigan to the ore mine. They had walked through 
the ledges of an empty pit, with the remnants of a crane like a skeleton 
bending above them against the sky, and someone's rusted lunchbox clattering 
away from under their feet. She had felt a stab of uneasiness, sharper than 
sadness— but Rearden had said cheerfully, "Exhausted, hell! I'll show them how 
many tons and dollars I can draw out of this place!" On their way back to the 
car, he had said, "If I could find the right man, I'd buy that mine for him 
tomorrow morning and set him up to work it." 



The next day, when they were driving west and south, toward the plains of 
Illinois, he had said suddenly, after a long silence, "No, I'll have to wait 
till they junk the Bill. The man who could work that mine, wouldn't need me 
to teach him. The man who'd need me, wouldn't be worth a damn." 

They could speak of their work, as they always had, with full confidence 
in being understood. But they never spoke of each other. He acted as if their 
passionate intimacy were a nameless physical fact, not to be identified in 
the communication between two minds. Each night, it was as if she lay in the 
arms of a stranger who let her see every shudder of sensation that ran 
through his body, but would never permit her to know whether the shocks 
reached any answering tremor within him. She lay naked at his side, but on 
her wrist there was the bracelet of Rearden Metal. 

She knew that he hated the ordeal of signing the "Mr. and Mrs. 

Smith" on the registers of squalid roadside hotels. There were evenings 
when she noticed the faint contraction of anger in the tightness of his 
mouth, as he signed the expected names of the expected fraud, anger at those 
who made fraud necessary. She noticed, indifferently, the air of knowing 
slyness in the manner of the hotel clerks, which seemed to suggest that 
guests and clerks alike were accomplices in a shameful guilt: the guilt of 
seeking pleasure. But she knew that it did not matter to him when they were 
alone, when he held her against him for a moment and she saw his eyes look 
alive and guiltless. 

They drove through small towns, through obscure side roads, through the 
kind of places they had not seen for years. She felt uneasiness at the sight 
of the towns. Days passed before she realized what it was that she missed 
most: a glimpse of fresh paint. The houses stood like men in unpressed suits, 
who had lost the desire to stand straight: the cornices were like sagging 
shoulders, the crooked porch steps like torn hem lines, the broken windows 
like patches, mended with clapboard. The people in the streets stared at the 
new car, not as one stares at a rare sight, but as if the glittering black 
shape were an impossible vision from another world. There were few vehicles 
in the streets and too many of them were horse-drawn. She had forgotten the 
literal shape and usage of horsepower; she did not like to see its return. 

She did not laugh, that day at the grade crossing, when Rearden chuckled, 
pointing, and she saw the train of a small local railroad come tottering from 
behind a hill, drawn by an ancient locomotive that coughed black smoke 
through a tall stack. 

"Oh God, Hank, it's not funny!" 

"I know," he said. 

They were seventy miles and an hour away from it, when she said, "Hank, do 
you see the Taggart Comet being pulled across the continent by a coal-burner 
of that kind?" 

"What's the matter with you? Pull yourself together." 

"I'm sorry . . . It's just that I keep thinking it won't be any use, all 
my new track and all your new furnaces, if we don't find someone able to 
produce Diesel engines. If we don't find him fast," 

"Ted Nielsen of Colorado is your man." 

"Yes, if he finds a way to open his new plant. He's sunk more money than 
he should into the bonds of the John Gait Line." 

"That's turned out to be a pretty profitable investment, hasn't it?" 

"Yes, but it's held him up. Now he's ready to go ahead, but he can't find 
the tools. There are no machine tools to buy, not anywhere, not at any price. 
He's getting nothing but promises and delays. He's combing the country, 
looking for old junk to reclaim, from closed factories. If he doesn't start 
soon—" 

"He will. Who's going to stop him now?" 

"Hank," she said suddenly, "could we go to a place I'd like to see?" 



"Sure, Anywhere. Which place?" 

"It's in Wisconsin. There used to be a great motor company there, in my 
father's time. We had a branch line serving it, but we closed the line— about 
seven years ago— when they closed the factory. I think it's one of those 
blighted areas now. Maybe there's still some machinery left there that Ted 
Nielsen could use. It might have been overlooked— the place is forgotten and 
there's no transportation to it at all." 

"I'll find it. What was the name of the factory?" 

"The Twentieth Century Motor Company." 

"Oh, of course! That was one of the best motor firms in my youth, perhaps 
the best. I seem to remember that there was something odd about the way it 
went out of business . . . can't recall what it was. '1 

It took them three days of inquiries, but they found the bleached, 
abandoned road— and now they were driving through the yellow leaves that 
glittered like a sea of gold coins, to the Twentieth Century Motor Company. 

"Hank, what if anything happens to Ted Nielsen?" she asked suddenly, as 
they drove in silence. 

"Why should anything happen to him?" 

"I don't know, but . . . well, there was Dwight Sanders. He vanished. 
United Locomotives is done for now. And the other plants are in no condition 
to produce Diesels. I've stopped listening to promises. And . . . and of what 
use is a railroad without motive power?" 

"Of what use is anything, for that matter, without it?" 

The leaves sparkled, swaying in the wind. They spread for miles, from 
grass to brush to trees, with the motion and all the colors of fire; they 
seemed to celebrate an accomplished purpose, burning in unchecked, untouched 
abundance . 

Rearden smiled. "There's something to be said for the wilderness. 

I'm beginning to like it. New country that nobody's discovered." She 
nodded gaily. "It's good soil— look at the way things grow. I'd clear that 
brush and I'd build a—" 

And then they stopped smiling. The corpse they saw in the weeds by the 
roadside was a rusty cylinder with bits of glass— the remnant of a gas-station 
pump . 

It was the only thing left visible. The few charred posts, the slab of 
concrete and the sparkle of glass dust— which had been a gas station- 
were swallowed in the brush, not to be noticed except by a careful glance, 
not to be seen at all in another year. 

They looked away. They drove on, not wanting to know what else lay hidden 
under the miles of weeds. They felt the same wonder like a weight in the 
silence between them: wonder as to how much the weeds had swallowed and how 
fast . 

The road ended abruptly behind the turn of a hill. What remained was a few 
chunks of concrete sticking out of a long, pitted stretch of tar and mud. The 
concrete had been smashed by someone and carted away; even weeds could not 
grow in the strip of earth left behind. On the crest of a distant hill, a 
single telegraph pole stood slanted against the sky, like a cross over a vast 
grave . 

It took them three hours and a punctured tire to crawl in low gear through 
trackless soft, through gullies, then down ruts left by cart wheels— to reach 
the settlement that lay in the valley beyond the hill with the telegraph 
pole . 

A few houses still stood within the skeleton of what had once been an 
industrial town. Everything that could move, had moved away; but some human 
beings had remained. The empty structures were vertical rubble; they had been 
eaten, not by time, but by men: boards torn out at random, missing patches of 
roofs, holes left in gutted cellars. It looked as if blind hands had seized 



whatever fitted the need of the moment, with no concept of remaining in 
existence the next morning. 

The inhabited houses were scattered at random among the ruins; the smoke 
of their chimneys was the only movement visible in town. A shell of concrete, 
which had been a schoolhouse, stood on the outskirts; it looked like a skull, 
with the empty sockets of glassless windows, with a few strands of hair still 
clinging to it, in the shape of broken wires. 

Beyond the town, on a distant hill, stood the factory of the Twentieth 
Century Motor Company. Its walls, roof lines and smokestacks looked trim, 
impregnable like a fortress. It would have seemed intact but for a silver 
water tank: the water tank was tipped sidewise. 

They saw no trace of a road to the factory in the tangled miles of trees 
and hillsides. They drove to the door of the first house in sight that showed 
a feeble signal of rising smoke. The door was open. An old woman came 
shuffling out at the sound of the motor. She was bent and swollen, 
barefooted, dressed in a garment of flour sacking. She looked at the car 
without astonishment, without curiosity; it was the blank stare of a being 
who had lost the capacity to feel anything but exhaustion. 

"Can you tell me the way to the factory?" asked Rearden. 

The woman did not answer at once; she looked as if she would be unable to 
speak English. "What factory?" she asked. 
Rearden pointed. "That one." 
"It's closed." 

"I know it's closed. But is there any way to get there?" 

" I don ' t know . " 

"Is there any sort of road?" 

"There's roads in the woods." 

"Any for a car to drive through?" 

"Maybe . " 

"Well, which would be the best road to take?" 
"I don't know." 

Through the open door, they could see the interior of her house. 

There was a useless gas stove, its oven stuffed with rags, serving as a 
chest of drawers. There was a stove built of stones in a corner, with a few 
logs burning under an old kettle, and long streaks of soot rising up the 
wall. A white object lay propped against the legs of a table: it was a 
porcelain washbowl, torn from the wall of some bathroom, filled with wilted 
cabbages. A tallow candle stood in a bottle on the table. There was no paint 
left on the floor; its boards were scrubbed to a soggy gray that looked like 
the visual expression of the pain in the bones of the person who had bent and 
scrubbed and lost the battle against the grime now soaked into the grain of 
the boards . 

A brood of ragged children had gathered at the door behind the woman, 
silently, one by one. They stared at the car, not with the bright curiosity 
of children, but with the tension of savages ready to vanish at the first 
sign of danger. 

"How many miles is it to the factory?" asked Rearden. 

"Ten miles," said the woman, and added, "Maybe five." 

"How far is the next town?" 

"There ain't any next town." 

"There are other towns somewhere. I mean, how far?" 
"Yeah. Somewhere." 

In the vacant space by the side of the house, they saw faded rags hanging 
on a clothesline, which was a piece of telegraph wire. Three chickens pecked 
among the beds of a scraggly vegetable garden; a fourth sat roosting on a bar 
which was a length of plumber's pipe. Two pigs waddled in a stretch of mud 



and refuse; the stepping stones laid across the muck were pieces of the 
highway's concrete. 

They heard a screeching sound in the distance and saw a man drawing water 
from a public well by means of a rope pulley. They watched him as he came 
slowly down the street. He carried two buckets that seemed too heavy for his 
thin arms. One could not tell his age. 

He approached and stopped, looking at the car. His eyes darted at the 
strangers, then away, suspicious and furtive. 

Rearden took out a ten-dollar bill and extended it to him, asking, "Would 
you please tell us the way to the factory?" 

The man stared at the money with sullen indifference, not moving, not 
lifting a hand for it, still clutching the two buckets. If one were ever to 
see a man devoid of greed, thought Dagny, there he was. 

"We don't need no money around here," he said. 

"Don't you work for a living?" 

"Yeah. " 

"Well, what do you use for money?" 

The man put the buckets down, as if it had just occurred to him that he 
did not have to stand straining under their weight. "We don't use no money," 
he said. "We just trade things amongst us." 

"How do you trade with people from other towns?" 

"We don't go to no other towns." 

"You don't seem to have it easy here." 

"What's that to you?" 

"Nothing. Just curiosity. Why do you people stay here?" 

"My old man used to have a grocery store here. Only the factory closed." 
"Why didn't you move?" 
"Where to?" 
"Anywhere . " 
"What for?" 

Dagny was staring at the two buckets: 
handles; they had been oil cans. 

"Listen," said Rearden, "can you tell us whether there' 
factory?" 

"There's plenty of roads." 

"Is there one that a car can take?" 

"I guess so." 

"Which one?" 

The man weighed the problem earnestly for some moments, 
turn to the left by the schoolhouse, " he said, "and go on til you come to the 
crooked oak, there's a road up there that's fine when it don't rain for a 
couple of weeks." 

"When did it rain last?" 

"Yesterday . " 

"Is there another road?" 

"Well, you could go through Hanson's pasture and across the woods and then 
there's a good, solid road there, all the way down to the creek." 
"Is there a bridge across the creek?" 
"No. " 

"What are the other roads?" 

"Well, if it's a car road that you want, there's one the other side of 
Miller's patch, it's paved, it's the best road for a car, you just turn to 
the right by the schoolhouse and—" 

"But that road doesn't go to the factory, does it?" 

"No, not to the factory." 

"All right," said Rearden. "Guess we'll find our own way." 



they were square tins with rope

He had pressed the starter, when a rock came smashing into the windshield. 
The glass was shatterproof, but a sunburst of cracks spread across it. They 
saw a ragged little hoodlum vanishing behind a corner with a scream of 
laughter, and they heard the shrill laughter of children answering him from 
behind some windows or crevices. 

Rearden suppressed a swear word. The man looked vapidly across the street, 
frowning a little. The old woman looked on, without reaction. She had stood 
there silently, watching, without interest or purpose, like a chemical 
compound on a photographic plate, absorbing visual shapes because they were 
there to be absorbed, but unable ever to form any estimate of the objects of 
her vision. 

Dagny had been studying her for some minutes. The swollen shapelessness of 
the woman's body did not look like the product of age and neglect: it looked 
as if she was pregnant. This seemed impossible, but glancing closer Dagny saw 
that her dust-colored hair was not gray and that there were few wrinkles on 
her face; it was only the vacant eyes, the stooped shoulders, the shuffling 
movements that gave her the stamp of senility. 

Dagny leaned out and asked, "How old are you?" 

The woman looked at her, not in resentment, but merely as one looks at a 
pointless question. "Thirty-seven," she answered. 

They had driven five former blocks away, when Dagny spoke. 

"Hank, " she said in terror, "that woman is only two years older than I ! " 

"Yes . " 

"God, how did they ever come to such a state?" 
He shrugged. "Who is John Gait?" 

The last thing they saw, as they left the town, was a billboard. A design 
was still visible on its peeling strips, imprinted in the dead gray that had 
once been color. It advertised a washing machine. 

In a distant field, beyond the town, they saw the figure of a man moving 
slowly, contorted by the ugliness of a physical effort beyond the proper use 
of a human body: he was pushing a plow by hand. 

They reached the factory of the Twentieth Century Motor Company two miles 
and two hours later. They knew, as they climbed the hill, that their quest 
was useless. A rusted padlock hung on the door of the main entrance, but the 
huge windows were shattered and the place was open to anyone, to the 
woodchucks, the rabbits and the dried leaves that lay in drifts inside. 

The factory had been gutted long ago. The great pieces of machinery had 
been moved out by some civilized means— the neat holes of their bases still 
remained in the concrete of the floor. The rest had gone to random looters. 
There was nothing left, except refuse which the neediest tramp had found 
worthless, piles of twisted, rusted scraps, of boards, plaster and glass 
splinters— and the steel stairways, built to last and lasting, rising in trim 
spirals to the roof. 

They stopped in the great hall where a ray of light fell diagonally from a 
gap in the ceiling, and the echoes of their steps rang around them, dying far 
away in rows of empty rooms. A bird darted from among the steel rafters and 
went in a hissing streak of wings out into the sky, "We'd better look through 
it, just in case," said Dagny. "You take the shops and I'll take the annexes. 
Let's do it as fast as possible." 

"I don't like to let you wander around alone. I don't know how safe they 
are, any of those floors or stairways." 

"Oh, nonsense! I can find my way around a factory— or in a wrecking crew. 
Let's get it over with. I want to get out of here." 

When she walked through the silent yards— where steel bridges still hung 
overhead, tracing lines of geometrical perfection across the sky —her only 
wish was not to see any of it, but she forced herself to look. 



It was like having to perform an autopsy on the body of one's love. She 
moved her glance as an automatic searchlight, her teeth clamped tight 
together. She walked rapidly— there was no necessity to pause anywhere. 

It was in a room of what had been the laboratory that she stopped. It was 
a coil of wire that made her stop. The coil protruded from a pile of junk. 
She had never seen that particular arrangement of wires, yet it seemed 
familiar, as if it touched the hint of some memory, faint and very distant. 
She reached for the coil, but could not move it: it seemed to be part of some 
object buried in the pile. 

The room looked as if it had been an experimental laboratory— if she was 
right in judging the purpose of the torn remnants she saw on the walls: a 
great many electrical outlets, bits of heavy cable, lead conduits, glass 
tubing, built-in cabinets without shelves or doors. There was a great deal of 
glass, rubber, plastic and metal in the junk pile, and dark gray splinters of 
slate that had been a blackboard. Scraps of paper rustled dryly all over the 
floor. There were also remnants of things which had not been brought here by 
the owner of that room: popcorn wrappers, a whiskey bottle, a confession 
magazine . 

She attempted to extricate the coil from the scrap pile. It would not 
move; it was part of some large object. She knelt and began to dig through 
the junk. 

She had cut her hands, she was covered with dust by the time she stood up 
to look at the object she had cleared. It was the broken remnant of the model 
of a motor. Most of its parts were missing, but enough was left to convey 
some idea of its former shape and purpose. 

She had never seen a motor of this kind or anything resembling it. 

She could not understand the peculiar design of its parts or the functions 
they were intended to perform. 

She examined the tarnished tubes and odd-shaped connections. She tried to 
guess their purpose, her mind going over every type of motor she knew and 
every possible kind of work its parts could perform. 

None fitted the model. It looked like an electric motor, but she could not 
tell what fuel it was intended to burn. It was not designed for steam, or 
oil, or anything she could name. 

Her sudden gasp was not a sound, but a jolt that threw her at the junk 
pile. She was on her hands and knees, crawling over the wreckage, seizing 
every piece of paper in sight, flinging it away, searching further. Her hands 
were shaking. 

She found part of what she hoped had remained in existence. It was a thin 
sheaf of typewritten pages clamped together— the remnant of a manuscript. Its 
beginning and end were gone; the bits of paper left under the clamp showed 
the thick number of pages it had once contained. The paper was yellowed and 
dry. The manuscript had been a description of the motor. 

From the empty enclosure of the plant's powerhouse, Rearden heard her 
voice screaming, "Hank!" It sounded like a scream of terror. 

He ran in the direction of the voice. He found her standing in the middle 
of a room, her hands bleeding, her stockings torn, her suit smeared with 
dust, a bunch of papers clutched in her hand. 

"Hank, what does this look like?" she asked, pointing at an odd piece of 
wreckage at her feet; her voice had the intense, obsessed tone of a person 
stunned by a shock, cut off from reality. "What does it look like?" 

"Are you hurt? What happened?" 

"No! . . . Oh, never mind, don't look at me! I'm all right. Look at this. 
Do you know what that is?" 

"What did you do to yourself?" 

"I had to dig it out of there. I'm all right." 
"You're shaking." 



"You will, too, in a moment. Hank! Look at it. Just look and tell me what 
you think it is." 

He glanced down, then looked attentively— then he was sitting on the floor, 
studying the object intently. "It's a queer way to put a motor together," he 
said, frowning. 

"Read this," she said, extending the pages. 

He read, looked up and said, "Good God!" 

She was sitting on the floor beside him, and for a moment they could say 
nothing else. 

"It was the coil," she said. She felt as if her mind were racing, she 
could not keep up with all the things which a sudden blast had opened to her 
vision, and her words came hurtling against one another. "It was the coil 
that I noticed first— because I had seen drawings like it, not quite, but 
something like it, years ago, when I was in school— it was in an old book, it 
was given up as impossible long, long ago— but I liked to read everything I 
could find about railroad motors. That book said that there was a time when 
men were thinking of it— they worked on it, they spent years on experiments, 
but they couldn't solve it and they gave it up. It was forgotten for 
generations. I didn't think that any living scientist ever thought of it now. 
But someone did. 

Someone has solved it, now, today! . . . Hank, do you understand? 

Those men, long ago, tried to invent a motor that would draw static 
electricity from the atmosphere, convert it and create its own power as it 
went along. They couldn't do it. They gave it up." She pointed at the broken 
shape. "But there it is." 

He nodded. He was not smiling. He sat looking at the remnant, intent on 
some thought of his own; it did not seem to be a happy thought. 

"Hank! Don't you understand what this means? It's the greatest revolution 
in power motors since the internal-combustion engine- 
greater than that! It wipes everything out— and makes everything possible. 
To hell with Dwight Sanders and all of them! Who'll want to look at a Diesel? 
Who'll want to worry about oil, coal or refueling stations? Do you see what I 
see? A brand-new locomotive half the size of a single Diesel unit, and with 
ten times the power. A self -generator , working on a few drops of fuel, with 
no limits to its energy. The cleanest, swiftest, cheapest means of motion 
ever devised. Do you see what this will do to our transportation systems and 
to the country— in about one year?" 

There was no spark of excitement in his face. He said slowly, "Who 
designed it? Why was it left here?" 

"We'll find out." 

He weighed the pages in his hand reflectively. "Dagny, " he asked, "if you 
don't find the man who made it, will you be able to reconstruct that motor 
from what is left?" 

She took a long moment, then the word fell with a sinking sound: "No." 

"Nobody will. He had it all right. It worked— j udging by what he writes 
here. It is the greatest thing I've ever laid eyes on. It was. We can't make 
it work again. To supply what's missing would take a mind as great as his." 

"I'll find him— if I have to drop every other thing I'm doing." 

"—and if he's still alive." 

She heard the unstated guess in the tone of his voice. "Why do you say it 
like that?" 

"I don't think he is. If he were, would he leave an invention of this kind 
to rot on a junk pile? Would he abandon an achievement of this size? If he 
were still alive, you would have had the locomotives with the self-generators 
years ago. And you wouldn't have had to look for him, because the whole world 
would know his name by now." 

"I don't think this model was made so very long ago." 



He looked at the paper of the manuscript and at the rusty tarnish of the 
motor. "About ten years ago, I'd guess. Maybe a little longer." 

"We've got to find him or somebody who knew him. This is more important—" 

«— than anything owned or manufactured by anyone today. I don't think we'll 
find him. And if we don't, nobody will be able to repeat his performance. 
Nobody will rebuild his motor. There's not enough of it left. It's only a 
lead, an invaluable lead, but it would take the sort of mind that's born once 
in a century, to complete it. Do you see our present-day motor designers 
attempting it?" 

"No . " 

"There's not a first-rate designer left. There hasn't been a new idea in 
motors for years. That's one profession that seems to be dying— or dead." 

"Hank, do you know what that motor would have meant, if built?" 

He chuckled briefly. "I'd say: about ten years added to the life of every 
person in this country— if you consider how many things it would have made 
easier and cheaper to produce, how many hours of human labor it would have 
released for other work, and how much more anyone's work would have brought 
him. Locomotives? What about automobiles and ships and airplanes with a motor 
of this kind? And tractors. 

And power plants. All hooked to an unlimited supply of energy, with no 
fuel to pay for, except a few pennies' worth to keep the converter going. 
That motor could have set the whole country in motion and on fire. It would 
have brought an electric light bulb into every hole, even into the homes of 
those people we saw down in the valley." 

"It would have? It will. I'm going to find the man who made it." 

"We'll try." 

He rose abruptly, but stopped to glance down at the broken remnant and 
said, with a chuckle that was not gay, "There was the motor for the John Gait 
Line. " 

Then he spoke in the brusque manner of an executive. "First, we'll try to 
see if we can find their personnel office here. We'll look for their records, 
if there's any left. We want the names of their research staff and their 
engineers. I don't know who owns this place now, and I suspect that the 
owners will be hard to find, or they wouldn't have let it come to this. Then 
we'll go over every room in the laboratory. 

Later, we'll get a few engineers to fly here and comb the rest of the 
place . " 

They started out, but she stopped for a moment on the threshold. 

"Hank, that motor was the most valuable thing inside this factory, " 

she said, her voice low. "It was more valuable than the whole factory and 
everything it ever contained. Yet it was passed up and left in the refuse. It 
was the one thing nobody found worth the trouble of taking." 

"That's what frightens me about this," he answered. 

The personnel office did not take them long. They found it by the sign 
which was left on the door, but it was the only thing left. There was no 
furniture inside, no papers, nothing but the splinters of smashed windows. 

They went back to the room of the motor. Crawling on hands and knees, they 
examined every scrap of the junk that littered the floor. 

There was little to find. They put aside the papers that seemed to contain 
laboratory notes, but none referred to the motor, and there were no pages of 
the manuscript among them. The popcorn wrappers and the whiskey bottle 
testified to the kind of invading hordes that had rolled through the room, 
like waves washing the remnants of destruction away to unknown bottoms. 

They put aside a few bits of metal that could have belonged to the motor, 
but these were too small to be of value. The motor looked as if parts of it 
had been ripped off, perhaps by someone who thought he could put them to some 
customary use. What had remained was too unfamiliar to interest anybody. 



On aching knees, her palms spread flat upon the gritty floor, she felt the 
anger trembling within her, the hurting, helpless anger that answers the 
sight of desecration. She wondered whether someone's diapers hung on a 
clothesline made of the motor's missing wires— whether its wheels had become a 
rope pulley over a communal well— whether its cylinder was now a pot 
containing geraniums on the window sill of the sweetheart of the man with the 
whiskey bottle. 

There was a remnant of light on the hill, but a blue haze was moving in 
upon the valleys, and the red and gold of the leaves was spreading to the sky 
in strips of sunset. 

It was dark when they finished. She rose and leaned against the empty 
frame of the window for a touch of cool air on her forehead. The sky was dark 
blue. "It could have set the whole country in motion and on fire." She looked 
down at the motor. She looked out at the country. She moaned suddenly, hit by 
a single long shudder, and dropped her head on her arm, standing pressed to 
the frame of the window. 

"What's the matter?" he asked. 

She did not answer. 

He looked out. Far below, in the valley, in the gathering night, there 
trembled a few pale smears which were the lights of tallow candles. 



CHAPTER X 
WYATT'S TORCH 



"God have mercy on us, ma'am!" said the clerk of the Hall of Records. 
"Nobody knows who owns that factory now. I guess nobody will ever know it, " 

The clerk sat at a desk in a ground-floor office, where dust lay 
undisturbed on the files and few visitors ever called. He looked at the 
shining automobile parked outside his window, in the muddy square that had 
once been the center of a prosperous county seat; he looked with a faint, 
wistful wonder at his two unknown visitors. 

"Why?" asked Dagny. 

He pointed helplessly at the mass of papers he had taken out of the files. 
"The court will have to decide who owns it, which I don't think any court can 
do. If a court ever gets to it. I don't think it will." 

"Why? What happened?" 

"Well, it was sold out— the Twentieth Century, I mean. The Twentieth 
Century Motor Company. It was sold twice, at the same time and to two 
different sets of owners. That was sort of a big scandal at the time, two 
years ago, and now it's just"— he pointed— " j ust a bunch of paper lying around, 
waiting for a court hearing. I don't see how any judge will be able to 
untangle any property rights out of it— or any right at all." 

"Would you tell me please just what happened?" 

"Well, the last legal owner of the factory was The People's Mortgage 
Company, of Rome, Wisconsin. That's the town the other side of the factory, 
thirty miles north. That Mortgage Company was a sort of noisy outfit that did 
a lot of advertising about easy credit. Mark Yonts was the head of it. Nobody 
knew where he came from and nobody knows where he's gone to now, but what 
they discovered, the morning after The People's Mortgage Company collapsed, 
was that Mark Yonts had sold the Twentieth Century Motor factory to a bunch 
of suckers from South Dakota, and that he'd also given it as collateral for a 
loan from a bank in Illinois. And when they took a look at the factory, they 
discovered that he'd moved all the machinery out and sold it piecemeal, God 
only knows where and to whom. So it seems like everybody owns the place— and 
nobody. That's how it stands now— the South Dakotans and the bank and the 
attorney for the creditors of The People's Mortgage Company all suing one 
another, all claiming this factory, and nobody having the right to move a 
wheel in it, except that there's no wheels left to move." 
"Did Mark Yonts operate the factory before he sold it?" 
"Lord, no, ma'am! He wasn't the kind that ever operates anything. 
He didn't want to make money, only to get it. Guess he got it, too- 
more than anyone could have made out of that factory." 

He wondered why the blond, hard-faced man, who sat with the woman in front 
of his desk, looked grimly out the window at their car, at a large object 
wrapped in canvas, roped tightly under the raised cover of the car's luggage 
compartment . 

"What happened to the factory records?" 

"Which do you mean, ma'am?" 

"Their production records. Their work records. Their . . . personnel 
files . " 

"Oh, there's nothing left of that now. There's been a lot of looting going 
on. All the mixed owners grabbed what furniture or things they could haul out 
of there, even if the sheriff did put a padlock on the door. The papers and 
stuff like that— I guess it was all taken by the scavengers from Starnesville, 
that's the place down in the valley, where they're having it pretty tough 
these days. They burned the stuff for kindling, most likely." 



"Is there anyone left here who used to work in the factory?" asked 
Rearden . 

"No, sir. Not around here. They all lived down in Starnesville . " 
"All of them?" whispered Dagny; she was thinking of the ruins. "The . . . 
engineers, too?" 

"Yes, ma'am. That was the factory town. They've all gone, long ago." 
"Do you happen to remember the names of any men who worked there?" 
"No, ma ' am. " 

"What owner was the last to operate the factory?" asked Rearden. 

"I couldn't say, sir. There's been so much trouble up there and the place 
has changed hands so many times, since old Jed Starnes died. 

He's the man who built the factory. He made this whole part of the 
country, I guess. He died twelve years ago." 

"Can you give us the names of all the owners since?" 

"No, sir. We had a fire in the old courthouse, about three years ago, and 
all the old records are gone. I don't know where you could trace them now." 

"You don't know how this Mark Yonts happened to acquire the factory?" 

"Yes, I know that. He bought it from Mayor Bascom of Rome. How Mayor 
Bascom happened to own it, I don't know." 

"Where is Mayor Bascom now?" 

"Still there, in Rome." 

"Thank you very much," said Rearden, rising. "We'll call on him." 
They were at the door when the clerk asked, "What is it you're looking 
for, sir?" 

"We're looking for a friend of ours," said Rearden. "A friend we've lost, 
who used to work in that factory." 

Mayor Bascom of Rome, Wisconsin, leaned back in his chair; his chest and 
stomach formed a pear-shaped outline under his soiled shirt. 

The air was a mixture of sun and dust, pressing heavily upon the porch of 
his house. He waved his arm, the ring on his finger flashing a large topaz of 
poor quality. 

"No use, no use, lady, absolutely no use," he said. "Would be just a waste 
of your time, trying to question the folks around here. There's no factory 
people left, and nobody that would remember much about them. So many families 
have moved away that what's left here is plain no good, if I do say so 
myself, plain no good, just being Mayor of a bunch of trash." 

He had offered chairs to his two visitors, but he did not mind it if the 
lady preferred to stand at the porch railing. He leaned back, studying her 
long-lined figure; high-class merchandise, he thought; but then, the man with 
her was obviously rich. 

Dagny stood looking at the streets of Rome. There were houses, sidewalks, 
lampposts, even a sign advertising soft drinks; but they looked as if it were 
now only a matter of inches and hours before the town would reach the stage 
of Starnesville. 

"Naw, there's no factory records left," said Mayor Bascom. "If that's what 
you want to find, lady, give it up. It's like chasing leaves in a storm now. 
Just like leaves in a storm. Who cares about papers? At a time like this, 
what people save is good, solid, material objects. One's got to be 
practical . " 

Through the dusty windowpanes, they could see the living room of his 
house: there were Persian rugs on a buckled wooden floor, a portable bar with 
chromium strips against a wall stained by the seepage of last year's rains, 
an expensive radio with an old kerosene lamp placed on top of it. 

"Sure, it's me that sold the factory to Mark Yonts. Mark was a nice 
fellow, a nice, lively, energetic fellow. Sure, he did trim a few corners, 
but who doesn't? Of course, he went a bit too far. That, I didn't expect. 



I thought he was smart enough to stay within the law— whatever ' s left of it 
nowadays . " 

Mayor Bascom smiled, looking at them in a manner of placid frankness. His 
eyes were shrewd without intelligence, his smile good-natured without 
kindness . 

"I don't think you folks are detectives," he said, "but even if you were, 
it wouldn't matter to me. I didn't get any rake-off from Mark, he didn't let 
me in on any of his deals, I haven't any idea where he's gone to now." He 
sighed. "I liked that fellow. Wish he'd stayed around. Never mind the Sunday 
sermons. He had to live, didn't he? He was no worse than anybody, only 
smarter. Some get caught at it and some don't— 

that's the only difference. . . . Nope, I didn't know what he was going to 
do with it, when he bought that factory. Sure, he paid me quite a bit more 
than the old booby trap was worth. Sure, he was doing me a favor when he 
bought it. Nope, I didn't put any pressure on him to make him buy it. Wasn't 
necessary. I'd done him a few favors before. There's plenty of laws that's 
sort of made of rubber, and a mayor's in a position to stretch them a bit for 
a friend. Well, what the hell? That's the only way anybody ever gets rich in 
this world"— he glanced at the luxurious black car— "as you ought to know." 

"You were telling us about the factory, " said Rearden, trying to control 
himself . 

"What I can't stand," said Mayor Bascom, "is people who talk about 
principles. No principle ever filled anybody's milk bottle. The only thing 
that counts in life is solid, material assets. It's no time for theories, 
when everything is falling to pieces around us. Well, me— I don't aim to go 
under. Let them keep their ideas and I'll take the factory. I don't want 
ideas, I just want my three square meals a day." 

"Why did you buy that factory?" 

"Why does anybody buy any business? To squeeze whatever can be squeezed 
out of it. I know a good chance when I see it. It was a bankruptcy sale and 
nobody much who'd want to bid on the old mess. So I got the place for 
peanuts. Didn't have to hold it long, either— Mark took it off my hands in 
two-three months. Sure, it was a smart deal, if I say so myself. No big 
business tycoon could have done any better with it." 

"Was the factory operating when you took it over?" 

"Naw. It was shut down." 

"Did you attempt to reopen it?" 

"Not me. I'm a practical person." 

"Can you recall the names of any men who worked there?" 
"No. Never met 'em." 

"Did you move anything out of the factory?" 

"Well, I'll tell you. I took a look around— and what I liked was old Jed's 
desk. Old led Starnes. He was a real big shot in his time. Wonderful desk, 
solid mahogany. So I carted it home. And some executive, don't know who he 
was, had a stall shower in his bathroom, the like of which I never saw. A 
glass door with a mermaid cut in the glass, real art work, and hot stuff, 
too, hotter than any oil painting. So I had that shower lifted and moved 
here. What the hell, I owned it, didn't I? I was entitled to get something 
valuable out of that factory." 

"Whose bankruptcy sale was it, when you bought the factory?" 

"Oh, that was the big crash of the Community National Bank in Madison. 
Boy, was that a crash! It just about finished the whole state of Wisconsin- 
sure finished this part of it. Some say it was this motor factory that broke 
the bank, but others say it was only the last drop in a leaking bucket, 
because the Community National had bum investments all over three or four 
states. Eugene Lawson was the head of it. The banker with a heart, they 
called him. He was quite famous in these parts two-three years ago." 



"Did Lawson operate the factory?" 

"No. He merely lent an awful lot of money on it, more than he could ever 
hope to get back out of the old dump. When the factory busted, that was the 
last straw for Gene Lawson. The bank busted three months later." He sighed. 
"It hit the folks pretty hard around here. They all had their life savings in 
the Community National." 

Mayor Bascom looked regretfully past his porch railing at his town. 

He jerked his thumb at a figure across the street: it was a white-haired 
charwoman, moving painfully on her knees, scrubbing the steps of a house. 

"See that woman, for instance? They used to be solid, respectable folks. 
Her husband owned the dry-goods store. He worked all his life to provide for 
her in her old age, and he did, too, by the time he died— 

only the money was in the Community National Bank." 

"Who operated the factory when it failed?" 

"Oh, that was some quicky corporation called Amalgamated Service, Inc. 
Just a puff-ball. Came up out of nothing and went back to it." 
"Where are its members?" 

"Where are the pieces of a puff-ball when it bursts? Try and trace them 
all over the United States. Try it." 
"Where is Eugene Lawson?" 

"Oh, him? He's done all right. He's got a job in Washington— in the Bureau 
of Economic Planning and National Resources." 

Rearden rose too fast, thrown to his feet by a jolt of anger, then said, 
controlling himself, "Thank you for the information." 

"You're welcome, friend, you're welcome," said Mayor Bascom placidly. "I 
don't know what it is you're after, but take my word for it, give it up. 
There's nothing more to be had out of that factory." 

"I told you that we are looking for a friend of ours." 

"Well, have it your way. Must be a pretty good friend, if you'll go to so 
much trouble to find him, you and the charming lady who is not your Wife." 

Dagny saw Rearden 's face go white, so that even his lips became a 
sculptured feature, indistinguishable against his skin. "Keep your dirty — " 

he began, but she stepped between them. 

"Why do you think that I am not his wife?" she asked calmly. 

Mayor Bascom looked astonished by Rearden 's reaction; he had made the 
remark without malice, merely like a fellow cheat displaying his shrewdness 
to his partners in guilt. 

"Lady, I've seen a lot in my lifetime," he said good-naturedly. "Married 
people don't look as if they have a bedroom on their minds when they look at 
each other. In this world, either you're virtuous or you enjoy yourself. Not 
both, lady, not both." 

"I've asked him a question," she said to Rearden in time to silence him. 
"He's given me an instructive explanation." 

"If you want a tip, lady," said Mayor Bascom, "get yourself a wedding ring 
from the dime store and wear it. It's not sure fire, but it helps." 

"Thank you," she said, "Good-bye." 

The stern, stressed calm of her manner was a command that made Rearden 
follow her back to their car in silence. 

They were miles beyond the town when he said, not looking at her, his 
voice desperate and low, "Dagny, Dagny, Dagny . . .I'm sorry!" 

"I'm not. " 

Moments later, when she saw the look of control returning to his face, she 
said, "Don't ever get angry at a man for stating the truth." 
"That particular truth was none of his business." 

"His particular estimate of it was none of your concern or mine." 
He said through his teeth, not as an answer, but as if the single thought 
battering his brain turned into sounds against his will, 'T 



couldn't protect you from that unspeakable little—" 

"I didn't need protection." 

He remained silent, not looking at her. 

"Hank, when you're able to keep down the anger, tomorrow or next week, 
give some thought to that man's explanation and see if you recognize any part 
of it." 

He jerked his head to glance at her, but said nothing. 

When he spoke, a long time later, it was only to say in a tired, even 
voice, "We can't call New York and have our engineers come here to search the 
factory. We can't meet them here. We can't let it be known that we found the 
motor together. ... I had forgotten all that . . . 

up there ... in the laboratory." 

"Let me call Eddie, when we find a telephone. I'll have him send two 
engineers from the Taggart staff. I'm here alone, on my vacation, for all 
they'll know or have to know." 

They drove two hundred miles before they found a long-distance telephone 
line. When she called Eddie Willers, he gasped, hearing her voice. 

"Dagny! For God's sake, where are you?" 

"In Wisconsin. Why?" 

"1 didn't know where to reach you. You'd better come back at once. 
As fast as you can." 
"What happened?" 

"Nothing— yet . But there are things going on, which . . . You'd better stop 
them now, if you can. If anybody can." 
"What things?" 

"Haven't you been reading the newspapers?" 
"No . " 

"I can't tell you over the phone. I can't give you all the details. 
Dagny, you'll think I'm insane, but I think they're planning to kill 
Colorado . " 

"I'll come back at once," she said. 

Cut into the granite of Manhattan, under the Taggart Terminal, there were 
tunnels which had once been used as sidings, at a time when traffic ran in 
clicking currents through every artery of the Terminal every hour of the day. 
The need for space had shrunk through the years, with the shrinking of the 
traffic, and the side tunnels had been abandoned, like dry river beds; a few 
lights remained as blue patches on the granite over rails left to rust on the 
ground. 

Dagny placed the remnant of the motor into a vault in one of the tunnels; 
the vault had once contained an emergency electric generator, which had been 
removed long ago. She did not trust the useless young men of the Taggart 
research staff; there were only two engineers of talent among them, who could 
appreciate her discovery. She had shared her secret with the two and sent 
them to search the factory in Wisconsin. Then she had hidden the motor where 
no one else would know of its existence. 

When her workers carried the motor down to the vault and departed, she was 
about to follow them and lock the steel door, but she stopped, key in hand, 
as if the silence and solitude had suddenly thrown her at the problem she had 
been facing for days, as if this were the moment to make her decision. 

Her office car was waiting for her at one of the Terminal platforms, 
attached to the end of a train due to leave for Washington in a few minutes. 
She had made an appointment to see Eugene Lawson, but she had told herself 
that she would cancel it and postpone her quest— if she could think of some 
action to take against the things she had found on her return to New York, 
the things Eddie begged her to fight. 

She had tried to think, but she could see no way of fighting, no rules of 
battle, no weapons. Helplessness was a strange experience, new to her; she 



had never found it hard to face things and make decisions; but she was not 
dealing with things— this was a fog without shapes or definitions, in which 
something kept forming and shifting before it could be seen, like semi-clots 
in a not-quite-liquid— it was as if her eyes were reduced to side-vision and 
she were sensing blurs of disaster coiling toward her, but she could not move 
her glance, she had no glance to move and focus. 

The Union of Locomotive Engineers was demanding that the maximum speed of 
all trains on the John Gait Line be reduced to sixty miles an hour. The Union 
of Railway Conductors and Brakemen was demanding that the length of all 
freight trains on the John Gait Line be reduced to sixty cars. 

The states of Wyoming, New Mexico, Utah and Arizona were demanding that 
the number of trains run in Colorado not exceed the number of trains run in 
each of these neighboring states. 

A group headed by Orren Boyle was demanding the passage of a Preservation 
of Livelihood Law, which would limit the production of Rearden Metal to an 
amount equal to the output of any other steel mill of equal plant capacity, A 
group headed by Mr. Mowen was demanding the passage of a Fair Share Law to 
give every customer who wanted it an equal supply of Rearden Metal. 

A group headed by Bertram Scudder was demanding the passage of a Public 
Stability Law, forbidding Eastern business firms to move out of their states. 

Wesley Mouch, Top Co-ordinator of the Bureau of Economic Planning and 
National Resources, was issuing a great many statements, the content and 
purpose of which could not be denned, except that the words "emergency 
powers" and "unbalanced economy" kept appearing in the text every few lines. 

"Dagny, by what right?" Eddie Willers had asked her, his voice quiet, but 
the words sounding like a cry. "By what right are they all doing it? 

By what right?" 

She had confronted James Taggart in his office and said, "Jim, this is 
your battle. I've fought mine. You're supposed to be an expert at dealing 
with the looters. Stop them." 

Taggart had said, not looking at her, "You can't expect to run the 
national economy to suit your own convenience." 

"I don't want to run the national economy! I want your national economy 
runners to leave me alone! I have a railroad to run— and I know what's going 
to happen to your national economy if my railroad collapses!" 

"I see no necessity for panic." 

"Jim, do I have to explain to you that the income from our Rio Norte Line 
is all we've got, to save us from collapsing? That we need every penny of it, 
every fare, every carload of freight— as fast as we can get it?" He had not 
answered. "When we have to use every bit of power in every one of our broken- 
down Diesels, when we don't have enough of them to give Colorado the service 
it needs— what ' s going to happen if we reduce the speed and the length of 
trains?" 

"Well, there's something to be said for the unions' viewpoint, too. 

With so many railroads closing and so many railroad men out of work, they 
feel that those extra speeds you've established on the Rio Norte Line are 
unfair— they feel that there should be more trains, instead, so that the work 
would be divided around— they feel that it's not fair for us to get all the 
benefit of that new rail, they want a share of it, too." 

"Who wants a share of it? In payment for what?" He had not answered. 
"Who'll bear the cost of two trains doing the work of one?" He had not 
answered. "Where are you going to get the cars and the engines?" He had not 
answered. "What are those men going to do after they've put Taggart 
Transcontinental out of existence?" 

"I fully intend to protect the interests of Taggart Transcontinental." 

"How?" He had not answered. "How— if you kill Colorado?" 



"It seems to me that before we worry about giving some people a chance to 
expand, we ought to give some consideration to the people who need a chance 
of bare survival." 

"If you kill Colorado, what is there going to be left for your damn 
looters to survive on?" 

"You have always been opposed to every progressive social measure. I seem 
to remember that you predicted disaster when we passed the Anti-dog-eat-dog 
Rule— but the disaster has not come." 

"Because I saved you, you rotten fools! I won't be able to save you this 
time!" He had shrugged, not looking at her. "And if I don't, who will?" He 
had not answered. 

It did not seem real to her, here, under the ground. Thinking of it here, 
she knew she could have no part in Jim's battle. There was no action she 
could take against the men of undefined thought, of unnamed motives, of 
unstated purposes, of unspecified morality. There was nothing she could say 
to them— nothing would be heard or answered. What were the weapons, she 
thought, in a realm where reason was not a weapon any longer? It was a realm 
she could not enter. She had to leave it to Jim and count on his self- 
interest. Dimly, she felt the chill of a thought telling her that self- 
interest was not Jim's motive. 

She looked at the object before her, a glass case containing the remnant 
of the motor. The man who made the motor— she thought suddenly, the thought 
coming like a cry of despair. She felt a moment's helpless longing to find 
him, to lean against him and let him tell her what to do. A mind like his 
would know the way to win this battle. 

She looked around her. In the clean, rational world of the underground 
tunnels, nothing was of so urgent an importance as the task of finding the 
man who made the motor. She thought: Could she delay it in order to argue 
with Orren Boyle?— to reason with Mr. Mowen?— to plead with Bertram Scudder? 
She saw the motor, completed, built into an engine that pulled a train of two 
hundred cars down a track of Rearden Metal at two hundred miles an hour. When 
the vision was within her reach, within the possible, was she to give it up 
and spend her time bargaining about sixty miles and sixty cars? She could not 
descend to an existence where her brain would explode under the pressure of 
forcing itself not to outdistance incompetence. She could not function to the 
rule of: Pipe down— keep down— slow down— don ' t do your best, it is not wanted! 

She turned resolutely and left the vault, to take the train for 
Washington . 

It seemed to her, as she locked the steel door, that she heard a faint 
echo of steps. She glanced up and down the dark curve of the tunnel. 

There was no one in sight; there was nothing but a string of blue lights 
glistening on walls of damp granite. 

Rearden could not fight the gangs who demanded the laws. The choice was to 
fight them or to keep his mills open. He had lost his supply of iron ore. He 
had to fight one battle or the other. There was no time for both. 

He had found, on his return, that a scheduled shipment of ore had not been 
delivered. No word or explanation had been heard from Larkin. When summoned 
to Rearden 's office, Larkin appeared three days later than the appointment 
made, offering no apology. He said, not looking at Rearden, his mouth drawn 
tightly into an expression of rancorous dignity: "After all, you can't order 
people to come running to your office any time you please." 

Rearden spoke slowly and carefully. "Why wasn't the ore delivered?" 

"I won't take abuse, I simply won't take any abuse for something I 
couldn't help. I can run a mine just as well as you ran it, every bit as 
well, I did everything you did— I don't know why something keeps going wrong 
unexpectedly all the time. I can't be blamed for the unexpected." 

"To whom did you ship your ore last month?" 



"I intended to ship you your share of it, I fully intended it, but I 
couldn't help it if we lost ten days of production last month on account of 
the rainstorm in the whole of north Minnesota— I intended to ship you the ore, 
so you can't blame me, because my intention was completely honest." 

"If one of my blast furnaces goes down, will I be able to keep it going by 
feeding your intention into it?" 

"That's why nobody can deal with you or talk to you— because you're 
inhuman, " 

"I have just learned that for the last three months, you have not been 
shipping your ore by the lake boats, you have been shipping it by rail. 
Why?" 

"Well, after all, I have a right to run my business as I see fit." 
"Why are you willing to pay the extra cost?" 
"What do you care? I'm not charging it to you." 

"What will you do when you find that you can't afford the rail rates and 
that you have destroyed the lake shipping?" 

"I am sure you wouldn't understand any consideration other than dollars 
and cents, but some people do consider their social and patriotic 
responsibilities . " 

"What responsibilities?" 

"Well, I think that a railroad like Taggart Transcontinental is essential 
to the national welfare and it is one's public duty to support Jim's 
Minnesota branch line, which is running at a deficit." 

Rearden leaned forward across the desk; he was beginning to see the links 
of a sequence he had never understood. "To whom did you ship your ore last 
month?" he asked evenly. 

"Well, after all, that is my private business which—" 

"To Orren Boyle, wasn't it?" 

"You can't expect people to sacrifice the entire steel industry of the 
nation to your selfish interests and—" 

"Get out of here," said Rearden. He said it calmly. The sequence was clear 
to him now. 

"Don't misunderstand me, I didn't mean—" 

"Get out." 

Larkin got out. 

Then there followed the days and nights of searching a continent by phone, 
by wire, by plane— of looking at abandoned mines and at mines ready to be 
abandoned— of tense, rushed conferences held at tables hi the unlighted 
corners of disreputable restaurants. Looking across the table, Rearden had to 
decide how much he could risk to invest upon the sole evidence of a man's 
face, manner and tone of voice, hating the state of having to hope for 
honesty as for a favor, but risking it, pouring money into unknown hands in 
exchange for unsupported promises, into unsigned, unrecorded loans to dummy 
owners of failing mines- 
money handed and taken furtively, as an exchange between criminals, in 
anonymous cash; money poured into unenforceable contracts— both parties 
knowing that in case of fraud, the defrauded was to be punished, not the 
def rauder— but poured that a stream of ore might continue flowing into 
furnaces, that the furnaces might continue to pour a stream of white metal. 

"Mr. Rearden," asked the purchasing manager of his mills, "if you keep 
that up, where will be your profit?" 

"We'll make it up on tonnage," said Rearden wearily. "We have an unlimited 
market for Rearden Metal." 

The purchasing manager was an elderly man with graying hair, a lean, dry 
face, and a heart which, people said, was given exclusively to the task of 
squeezing every last ounce of value out of a penny. He stood in front of 
Rearden 's desk, saying nothing else, merely looking straight at Rearden, his 



cold eyes narrowed and grim. It was a look of the most profound sympathy that 
Rearden had ever seen. 

There's no other course open, thought Rearden, as he had thought through 
days and nights. He knew no weapons but to pay for what he wanted, to give 
value for value, to ask nothing of nature without trading his effort in 
return, to ask nothing of men without trading the product of his effort. What 
were the weapons, he thought, if values were not a weapon any longer? 

"An unlimited market, Mr. Rearden?" the purchasing manager asked dryly. 

Rearden glanced up at him. "I guess I'm not smart enough to make the sort 
of deals needed nowadays," he said, in answer to the unspoken thoughts that 
hung across his desk. 

The purchasing manager shook his head. "No, Mr. Rearden, it's one or the 
other. The same kind of brain can't do both. Either you're good at running 
the mills or you're good at running to Washington." 

"Maybe I ought to learn their method." 

"You couldn't learn it and it wouldn't do you any good. You wouldn't win 
in any of those deals. Don't you understand? You're the one who's got 
something to be looted." 

When he was left alone, Rearden felt a jolt of blinding anger, as it had 
come to him before, painful, single and sudden like an electric shock— the 
anger bursting out of the knowledge that one cannot deal with pure evil, with 
the naked, full-conscious evil that neither has nor seeks justification. But 
when he felt the wish to fight and kill in the rightful cause of self- 
defense— he saw the fat, grinning face of Mayor Bascom and heard the drawling 
voice saying, ". . . you and the charming lady who is not your wife." 

Then no rightful cause was left, and the pain of anger was turning into 
the shameful pain of submission. He had no right to condemn anyone— he 
thought— to denounce anything, to fight and die joyously, claiming the 
sanction of virtue. The broken promises, the unconfessed desires, the 
betrayal, the deceit, the lies, the fraud— he was guilty of them all. What 
form of corruption could he scorn? Degrees do not matter, he thought; one 
does not bargain about inches of evil. 

He did not know— as he sat slumped at his desk, thinking of the honesty he 
could claim no longer, of the sense of justice he had lost— 

that it was his rigid honesty and ruthless sense of justice that were now 
knocking his only weapon out of his hands. He would fight the looters, but 
the wrath and fire were gone. He would fight, but only as one guilty wretch 
against the others. He did not pronounce the words, but the pain was their 
equivalent, the ugly pain saying: Who am I to cast the first stone? 

He let his body fall across the desk. . . . Dagny, he thought, Dagny, if 
this is the price I have to pay, I'll pay it. . . .He was still the trader 
who knew no code except that of full payment for his desires. 

It was late when he came home and hurried soundlessly up the stairs to his 
bedroom. He hated himself for being reduced to sneaking, but he had done it 
on most of his evenings for months. The sight of his family had become 
unbearable to him; he could not tell why. Don't hate them for your own guilt, 
he had told himself, but knew dimly that this was not the root of his hatred. 

He closed the door of his bedroom like a fugitive winning a moment's 
reprieve. He moved cautiously, undressing for bed: he wanted no sound to 
betray his presence to his family, he wanted no contact with them, not even 
in their own minds. 

He had put on his pajamas and stopped to light a cigarette, when the door 
of his bedroom opened. The only person who could properly enter his room 
without knocking had never volunteered to enter it, so he stared blankly for 
a moment before he was able to believe that it was Lillian who came in. 



She wore an Empire garment of pale chartreuse, its pleated skirt streaming 
gracefully from its high waistline; one could not tell at first glance 
whether it was an evening gown or a negligee; it was a negligee. 

She paused in the doorway, the lines of her body flowing into an 
attractive silhouette against the light. 

"I know I shouldn't introduce myself to a stranger," she said softly, "but 
I'll have to: my name is Mrs. Rearden." He could not tell whether it was 
sarcasm or a plea. 

She entered and threw the door closed with a casual, imperious gesture, 
the gesture of an owner. 

"What is it, Lillian?" he asked quietly. 

"My dear, you mustn't confess so much so bluntly"— she moved in a leisurely 
manner across the room, past his bed, and sat down in an armchair— "and so 
unf latteringly . It's an admission that I need to show special cause for 
taking your time. Should I make an appointment through your secretary?" 

He stood in the middle of the room, holding the cigarette at his lips, 
looking at her. volunteering no answer. 

She laughed. "My reason is so unusual that I know it will never occur to 
you: loneliness, darling. Do you mind throwing a few crumbs of your expensive 
attention to a beggar? Do you mind if I stay here without any formal reason 
at all?" 

"No," he said quietly, "not if you wish to." 

"I have nothing weighty to discuss— no million-dollar orders, no 
transcontinental deals, no rails, no bridges. Not even the political 
situation. I just want to chatter like a woman about perfectly unimportant 
things . " 

"Go ahead." 

"Henry, there's no better way to stop me, is there?" She had an air of 
helpless, appealing sincerity. "What can I say after that? Suppose I wanted 
to tell you about the new novel which Balph Eubank is writing— he is 
dedicating it to me— would that interest you?" 

"If it's the truth that you want— not in the least." 

She laughed. "And if it's not the truth that I want?" 

"Then I wouldn't know what to say," he answered— and felt a rush of blood 
to his brain, tight as a slap, realizing suddenly the double infamy of a lie 
uttered in protestation of honesty; he had said it sincerely, but it implied 
a boast to which he had no right any longer. "Why would you want it, if it's 
not the truth?" he asked. "What for?" 

"Now you see, that's the cruelty of conscientious people. You wouldn't 
understand it— would you?— if I answered that real devotion consists of being 
willing to lie, cheat and fake in order to make another person happy— to 
create for him the reality he wants, if he doesn't like the one that exists." 

"No," he said slowly, "I wouldn't understand it." 

"It's really very simple. If you tell a beautiful woman that she is 
beautiful, what have you given her? It's no more than a fact and it has cost 
you nothing. But if you tell an ugly woman that she is beautiful, you offer 
her the great homage of corrupting the concept of beauty. To love a woman for 
her virtues is meaningless. She's earned it, it's a payment, not a gift. But 
to love her for her vices is a real gift, unearned and undeserved. To love 
her for her vices is to defile all virtue for her sake— and that is a real 
tribute of love, because you sacrifice your conscience, your reason, your 
integrity and your invaluable self-esteem." 

He looked at her blankly. It sounded like some sort of monstrous 
corruption that precluded the possibility of wondering whether anyone could 
mean it; he wondered only what was the point of uttering it. 

"What's love, darling, if it's not self-sacrifice?" she went on lightly, 
in the tone of a drawing-room discussion. "What's self-sacrifice, unless one 



sacrifices that which is one's most precious and most important? But I don't 
expect you to understand it. Not a stainless-steel Puritan like you. 

That's the immense selfishness of the Puritan. You'd let the whole world 
perish rather than soil that immaculate self of yours with a single spot of 
which you'd have to be ashamed." 

He said slowly, his voice oddly strained and solemn, "I have never claimed 
to be immaculate." 

She laughed. "And what is it you're being right now? You're giving me an 
honest answer, aren't you?" She shrugged her naked shoulders. 

"Oh, darling, don't take me seriously! I'm just talking." 

He ground his cigarette into an ashtray; he did not answer. 

"Darling," she said, "I actually came here only because I kept thinking 
that I had a husband and I wanted to find out what he looked like." 

She studied him as he stood across the room, the tall, straight, taut 
lines of his body emphasized by the single color of the dark blue pajamas. 

"You're very attractive," she said. "You look so much better— these last 
few months. Younger. Should I say happier? You look less tense. 

Oh, I know you're rushed more than ever and you act like a commander in an 
air raid, but that's only the surface. You're less tense- 
inside . " 

He looked at her, astonished. It was true; he had not known it, had not 
admitted it to himself. He wondered at her power of observation. 

She had seen little of him in these last few months. He had not entered 
her bedroom since his return from Colorado. He had thought that she would 
welcome their isolation from each other. Now he wondered what motive could 
have made her so sensitive to a change in him— unless it was a feeling much 
greater than he had ever suspected her of experiencing. 

"I was not aware of it," he said. 

"It's quite becoming, dear— and astonishing, since you've been having such 
a terribly difficult time." 

He wondered whether this was intended as a question. She paused, as if 
waiting for an answer, but she did not press it and went on gaily: "I know 
you're having all sorts of trouble at the mills— and then the political 
situation is getting to be ominous, isn't it? If they pass those laws they're 
talking about, it will hit you pretty hard, won't it?" 

"Yes. It will. But that is a subject which is of no interest to you, 
Lillian, is it?" 

"Oh, but it is!" She raised her head and looked straight at him; her eyes 
had the blank, veiled look he had seen before, a look of deliberate mystery 
and of confidence in his inability to solve it. "It is of great interest to 
me . . . though not because of any possible financial losses," 

she added softly. 

He wondered, for the first time, whether her spite, her sarcasm, the 
cowardly manner of delivering insults under the protection of a smile, were 
not the opposite of what he had always taken them to be— not a method of 
torture, but a twisted form of despair, not a desire to make him suffer, but 
a confession of her own pain, a defense for the pride of an unloved wife, a 
secret plea— so that the subtle, the hinted, the evasive in her manner, the 
thing begging to be understood, was not the open malice, but the hidden love. 
He thought of it, aghast. It made his guilt greater than he had ever 
contemplated . 

"If we're talking politics, Henry, I had an amusing thought. The side you 
represent— what is that slogan you all use so much, the motto you're supposed 
to stand for? 'The sanctity of contract'— is that it?" 

She saw his swift glance, the intentness of his eyes, the first response 
of something she had struck, and she laughed aloud. 

"Go on," he said; his voice was low; it had the sound of a threat. 



"Darling, what for?— since you understood me quite well." 

"What was it you intended to say?" His voice was harshly precise and 
without any color of feeling. 

"Do you really wish to bring me to the humiliation of complaining? 

It's so trite and such a common complaint— although I did think I had a 
husband who prides himself on being different from lesser men. Do you want me 
to remind you that you once swore to make my happiness the aim of your life? 
And that you can't really say in all honesty whether I'm happy or unhappy, 
because you haven't even inquired whether I exist?" 

He felt them as a physical pain— all the things that came tearing at him 
impossibly together. Her words were a plea, he thought— and he felt the dark, 
hot flow of guilt. He felt pity— the cold ugliness of pity without affection. 
He felt a dim anger, like a voice he tried to choke, a voice crying in 
revulsion: Why should I deal with her rotten, twisted lying?— why should I 
accept torture for the sake of pity?— why is it I who should have to take the 
hopeless burden of trying to spare a feeling she won't admit, a feeling I 
can't know or understand or try to guess? 

—if she loves me, why doesn't the damn coward say so and let us both face 
it in the open? He heard another, louder voice, saying evenly: Don't switch 
the blame to her, that's the oldest trick of all cowards— 

you're guilty— no matter what she does, it's nothing compared to your 
guilt— she's right— it makes you sick, doesn't it, to know it's she who's 
right?— let it make you sick, you damn adulterer— it ' s she who's right! 

"What would make you happy, Lillian?" he asked. His voice was toneless. 

She smiled, leaning back in her chair, relaxing; she had been watching his 
face intently. 

"Oh, dear!" she said, as in bored amusement. "That's the shyster question. 
The loophole. The escape clause." 

She got up, letting her arms fall with a shrug, stretching her body in a 
limp, graceful gesture of helplessness. 

"What would make me happy, Henry? That is what you ought to tell me. That 
is what you should have discovered for me. I don't know. You were to create 
it and offer it to me. That was your trust, your obligation, your 
responsibility. But you won't be the first man to default on that promise. 
It's the easiest of all debts to repudiate. Oh, you'd never welsh on a 
payment for a load of iron ore delivered to you. Only on a life." 

She was moving casually across the room, the green-yellow folds of her 
skirt coiling in long waves about her, "I know that claims of this kind are 
impractical," she said. "I have no mortgage on you, no collateral, no guns, 
no chains. I have no hold on you at all, Henry— nothing but your honor." 

He stood looking at her as if it took all of his effort to keep his eyes 
directed at her face, to keep seeing her, to endure the sight. "What do you 
want?" he asked. 

"Darling, there are so many things you could guess by yourself, if you 
really wished to know what I want. For instance, if you have been avoiding me 
so blatantly for months, wouldn't I want to know the reason?" 

"I have been very busy." 

She shrugged. "A wife expects to be the first concern of her husband's 
existence. I didn't know that when you swore to forsake all others, it didn't 
include blast furnaces." 

She came closer and, with an amused smile that seemed to mock them both, 
she slipped her arms around him. 

It was the swift, instinctive, ferocious gesture of a young bridegroom at 
the unrequested contact of a whore— the gesture with which he tore her arms 
off his body and threw her aside. 

He stood, paralyzed, shocked by the brutality of his own reaction. 



She was staring at him, her face naked in bewilderment, with no mystery, 
no pretense or protection; whatever calculations she had made, this was a 
thing she had not expected. 

"I'm sorry, Lillian . . ."he said, his voice low, a voice of sincerity 
and of suffering. 

She did not answer. 

"I'm sorry . . . It's just that I'm very tired," he added, his voice 
lifeless; he was broken by the triple lie, one part of which was a disloyalty 
he could not bear to face; it was not the disloyalty to Lillian. 

She gave a brief chuckle. "Well, if that's the effect your work has on 
you, I may come to approve of it. Do forgive me, I was merely trying to do my 
duty. I thought that you were a sensualist who'd never rise above the 
instincts of an animal in the gutter. I'm not one of those bitches who belong 
in it." She was snapping the words dryly, absently, without thinking. Her 
mind was on a question mark, racing over every possible answer. 

It was her last sentence that made him face her suddenly, face her simply, 
directly, not as one on the defensive any longer. "Lillian, what purpose do 
you live for?" he asked. 

"What a crude question! No enlightened person would ever ask it." 

"Well, what is it that enlightened people do with their lives?" 

"Perhaps they do not attempt to do anything. That is their enlightenment." 

"What do they do with their time?" 

"They certainly don't spend it on manufacturing plumbing pipes." 
"Tell me, why do you keep making those cracks? I know that you feel 
contempt for the plumbing pipes. You've made that clear long ago. 
Your contempt means nothing to me. Why keep repeating it?" 

He wondered why this hit her; he did not know in what manner, but he knew 
that it did. He wondered why he felt with absolute certainty that that had 
been the right thing to say. 

She asked, her voice dry, "What's the purpose of the sudden 
questionnaire? " 

He answered simply, "I'd like to know whether there's anything that you 
really want. If there is, I'd like to give it to you, if I can." 

"You'd like to buy it? That's all you know— paying for things. You get off 
easily, don't you? No, it's not as simple as that. What I want is non- 
material . " 

"What is it?" 

"You. " 

"How do you mean that, Lillian? You don't mean it in the gutter sense." 
"No, not in the gutter sense." 
"How, then?" 

She was at the door, she turned, she raised her head to look at him and 
smiled coldly. 

"You wouldn't understand it," she said and walked out. 

The torture remaining to him was the knowledge that she would never want 
to leave him and he would never have the right to leave— 

the thought that he owed her at least the feeble recognition of sympathy, 
of respect for a feeling he could neither understand nor return— 

the knowledge that he could summon nothing for her, except contempt, a 
strange, total, unreasoning contempt, impervious to pity, to reproach, to his 
own pleas for justice— and, hardest to bear, the proud revulsion against his 
own verdict, against his demand that he consider himself lower than this 
woman he despised. 

Then it did not matter to him any longer, it all receded into some outer 
distance, leaving only the thought that he was willing to bear anything— 
leaving him in a state which was both tension and peace— because he lay in 
bed, his face pressed to the pillow, thinking of Dagny, of her slender, 



sensitive body stretched beside him, trembling under the touch of his 
fingers. He wished she were back in New York. If she were, he would have gone 
there, now, at once, in the middle of the night. 

Eugene Lawson sat at his desk as if it were the control panel of a bomber 
plane commanding a continent below. But he forgot it, at times, and slouched 
down, his muscles going slack inside his suit, as if he were pouting at the 
world. His mouth was the one part of him which he could not pull tight at any 
time; it was uncomfortably prominent in his lean face, attracting the eyes of 
any listener: when he spoke, the movement ran through his lower lip, twisting 
its moist flesh into extraneous contortions of its own. 

"I am not ashamed of it," said Eugene Lawson. "Miss Taggart, I want you to 
know that I am not ashamed of my past career as president of the Community 
National Bank of Madison." 

"I haven't made any reference to shame," said Dagny coldly. 

"No moral guilt can be attached to me, inasmuch as I lost everything I 
possessed in the crash of that bank. It seems to me that I would have the 
right to feel proud of such a sacrifice." 

"I merely wanted to ask you some questions about the Twentieth Century 
Motor Company which—" 

"I shall be glad to answer any questions. I have nothing to hide. My 
conscience is clear. If you thought that the subject was embarrassing to me, 
you were mistaken. '1 

"I wanted to inquire about the men who owned the factory at the time when 
you made a loan to—" 

"They were perfectly good men. They were a perfectly sound risk- 
though, of course, I am speaking in human terms, not in the terms of cold 
cash, which you are accustomed to expect from bankers. I granted them the 
loan for the purchase of that factory, because they needed the money. If 
people needed money, that was enough for me. Need was my standard, Miss 
Taggart. Need, not greed. My father and grandfather built up the Community 
National Bank just to amass a fortune for themselves. I placed their fortune 
in the service of a higher ideal. I did not sit on piles of money and demand 
collateral from poor people who needed loans. The heart was my collateral. Of 
course, I do not expect anyone in this materialistic country to understand 
me. The rewards I got were not of a kind that people of your class, Miss 
Taggart, would appreciate. The people who used to sit in front of my desk at 
the bank, did not sit as you do, Miss Taggart. They were humble, uncertain, 
worn with care, afraid to speak. My rewards were the tears of gratitude in 
their eyes, the trembling voices, the blessings, the woman who kissed my hand 
when I granted her a loan she had begged for in vain everywhere else." 

"Will you please tell me the names of the men who owned the motor 
factory?" 

"That factory was essential to the region, absolutely essential. I was 
perfectly justified in granting that loan. It provided employment for 
thousands of workers who had no other means of livelihood." 

"Did you know any of the people who worked in the factory?" 

"Certainly. I knew them all. It was men that interested me, not machines. 
I was concerned with the human side of industry, not the cash register side." 

She leaned eagerly across the desk. "Did you know any of the engineers who 
worked there?" 

"The engineers? No, no. I was much more democratic than that. It's the 
real workers that interested me. The common men. They all knew me by sight. I 
used to come into the shops and they would wave and shout, 'Hello, Gene.' 
That's what they called me— Gene. But I'm sure this is of no interest to you. 
It's past history. Now if you really came to Washington in order to talk to 
me about your railroad"— he straightened up briskly, the bomber-plane pose 
returning— "I don't know whether I can promise you any special consideration, 



inasmuch as I must hold the national welfare above any private privileges or 
interests which—" 

"1 didn't come to talk to you about my railroad," she said, looking at him 
in bewilderment. "I have no desire to talk to you about my railroad." 
"No?" He sounded disappointed. 

"No. I came for information about the motor factory. Could you possibly 
recall the names of any of the engineers who worked there?" 

"I don't believe I ever inquired about their names. I wasn't concerned 
with the parasites of office and laboratory. I was concerned with the real 
workers— the men of calloused hands who keep a factory going. They were my 
friends . " 

"Can you give me a few of their names? Any names, of anyone who worked 
there?" 

"My dear Miss Taggart, it was so long ago, there were thousands of them, 
how can I remember?" 

"Can't you recall one, any one?" 

"I certainly cannot. So many people have always filled my life that I 
can't be expected to recall individual drops in the ocean." 

"Were you familiar with the production of that factory? With the kind of 
work they were doing— or planning?" 

"Certainly. I took a personal interest in all my investments. I went to 
inspect that factory very often. They were doing exceedingly well. 

They were accomplishing wonders. The workers' housing conditions were the 
best in the country. I saw lace curtains at every window and flowers on the 
window sills. Every home had a plot of ground for a garden. They had built a 
new schoolhouse for the children." 

"Did you know anything about the work of the factory's research 
laboratory? " 

"Yes, yes, they had a wonderful research laboratory, very advanced, very 
dynamic, with forward vision and great plans." 

"Do you . . . remember hearing anything about . . . any plans to produce a 
new type of motor?" 

"Motor? What motor, Miss Taggart? I had no time for details. My objective 
was social progress, universal prosperity, human brotherhood and love. Love, 
Miss Taggart. That is the key to everything. If men learned to love one 
another, it would solve all their problems." 

She turned away, not to see the damp movements of his mouth. 

A chunk of stone with Egyptian hieroglyphs lay on a pedestal in a corner 
of the office— the statue of a Hindu goddess with six spider arms stood in a 
niche— and a huge graph of bewildering mathematical detail, like the sales 
chart of a mail-order house, hung on the wall. 

"Therefore, if you're thinking of your railroad, Miss Taggart— as, of 
course, you are, in view of certain possible developments— I must point out to 
you that although the welfare of the country is my first consideration, to 
which I would not hesitate to sacrifice anyone's profits, still, I have never 
closed my ears to a plea for mercy and—" 

She looked at him and understood what it was that he wanted from her, what 
sort of motive kept him going. 

"I don't wish to discuss my railroad," she said, fighting to keep her 
voice monotonously flat, while she wanted to scream in revulsion. "Anything 
you have to say on the subject, you will please say it to my brother, Mr. 
James Taggart." 

"I'd think that at a time like this you wouldn't want to pass up a rare 
opportunity to plead your case before—" 

"Have you preserved any records pertaining to the motor factory?" 
She sat straight, her hands clasped tight together. 



"What records? I believe I told you that I lost everything I owned when 
the bank collapsed." His body had gone slack once more, his interest had 
vanished. "But I do not mind it. What I lost was mere material wealth. I am 
not the first man in history to suffer for an ideal. I was defeated by the 
selfish greed of those around me. I couldn't establish a system of 
brotherhood and love in just one small state, amidst a nation of profit- 
seekers and dollar-grubbers. It was not my fault. But I won't let them beat 
me. I am not to be stopped. I am fighting— on a wider scale— for the privilege 
of serving my fellow men. Records, Miss Taggart? The record I left, when I 
departed from Madison, is inscribed in the hearts of the poor, who had never 
had a chance before." 

She did not want to utter a single unnecessary word; but she could not 
stop herself: she kept seeing the figure of the old charwoman scrubbing the 
steps. "Have you seen that section of the country since?" she asked. 

"It's not my fault!" he yelled. "It's the fault of the rich who still had 
money, but wouldn't sacrifice it to save my bank and the people of Wisconsin! 
You can't blame me! I lost everything!" 

"Mr. Lawson, " she said with effort, "do you perhaps recall the name of the 
man who headed the corporation that owned the factory? The corporation to 
which you lent the money. It was called Amalgamated Service, wasn't it? Who 
was its president?" 

"Oh, him? Yes, I remember him. His name was Lee Hunsacker. A very 
worthwhile young man, who's taken a terrible beating." 

"Where is he now? Do you know his address?" 

"Why— I believe he's somewhere in Oregon. Grangeville, Oregon. 

My secretary can give you his address. But I don't see of what interest . 
. . Miss Taggart, if what you have in mind is to try to see Mr. 

Wesley Mouch, let me tell you that Mr. Mouch attaches a great deal of 
weight to my opinion in matters affecting such issues as railroads and other— 

"I have no desire to see Mr. Mouch," she said, rising. 

"But then, I can't understand . . . What, really, was your purpose in 
coming here?" 

"I am trying to find a certain man who used to work for the Twentieth 
Century Motor Company." 

"Why do you wish to find him?" 

"I want him to work for my railroad." 

He spread his arms wide, looking incredulous and slightly indignant. 

"At such a moment, when crucial issues hang in the balance, you choose to 
waste your time on looking for some one employee? Believe me, the fate of 
your railroad depends on Mr. Mouch much more than on any employee you ever 
find. " 

"Good day," she said. 

She had turned to go, when he said, his voice jerky and high, "You haven't 
any right to despise me." 

She stopped to look at him. "I have expressed no opinion." 

"I am perfectly innocent, since I lost my money, since I lost all of my 
own money for a good cause. My motives were pure. I wanted nothing for 
myself. I've never sought anything for myself. Miss Taggart, I can proudly 
say that in all of my life I have never made a profit!" 

Her voice was quiet, steady and solemn: "Mr. Lawson, I think I should let 
you know that of all the statements a man can make, that is the one I 
consider most despicable." 

"I never had a chance!" said Lee Hunsacker. 

He sat in the middle of the kitchen, at a table cluttered with papers. 
He needed a shave; his shirt needed laundering. It was hard to judge his 
age: the swollen flesh of his face looked smooth and blank, untouched by 



experience; the graying hair and filmy eyes looked worn by exhaustion; he was 
forty-two . 

"Nobody ever gave me a chance. I hope they're satisfied with what they've 
made of me. But don't think that I don't know it. I know I was cheated out of 
my birthright. Don't let them put on any airs about how kind they are. 
They're a stinking bunch of hypocrites." 

"Who?" asked Dagny. 

"Everybody," said Lee Hunsacker. "People are bastards at heart and it's no 
use pretending otherwise. Justice? Huh! Look at it!" His arm swept around 
him. "A man like me reduced to this!" 

Beyond the window, the light of noon looked like grayish dusk among the 
bleak roofs and naked trees of a place that was not country and could never 
quite become a town. Dusk and dampness seemed soaked into the walls of the 
kitchen. A pile of breakfast dishes lay in the sink; a pot of stew simmered 
on the stove, emitting steam with the greasy odor of cheap meat; a dusty 
typewriter stood among the papers on the table. 

"The Twentieth Century Motor Company, " said Lee Hunsacker, "was one of the 
most illustrious names in the history of American industry. I was the 
president of that company. I owned that factory. 

But they wouldn't give me a chance." 

"You were not the president of the Twentieth Century Motor Company, were 
you? I believe you headed a corporation called Amalgamated Service?" 

"Yes, yes, but it's the same thing. We took over their factory. We were 
going to do just as well as they did. Better. We were just as important. Who 
the hell was Jed Starnes anyway? Nothing but a backwoods garage mechanic— did 
you know that that's how he started?— without any background at all. My family 
once belonged to the New York Four Hundred. My grandfather was a member of 
the national legislature. It's not my fault that my father couldn't afford to 
give me a car of my own, when he sent me to school. All the other boys had 
cars. My family name was just as good as any of theirs. When I went to 
college—" He broke off abruptly. "What newspaper did you say you're from?" 

She had given him her name; she did not know why she now felt glad that he 
had not recognized it and why she preferred not to enlighten him. "I did not 
say I was from a newspaper, " she answered, " j need some information on that 
motor factory for a private purpose of my own, not for publication." 

"Oh." He looked disappointed. He went on sullenly, as if she were guilty 
of a deliberate offense against him. "I thought maybe you came for an advance 
interview because I'm writing my autobiography." He pointed to the papers on 
the table. "And what I intend to tell is plenty. 

I intend— Oh, hell!" he said suddenly, remembering something. 

He rushed to the stove, lifted the lid off the pot and went through the 
motions of stirring the stew, hatefully, paying no attention to his 
performance. He flung the wet spoon down on the stove, letting the grease 
drip into the gas burners, and came back to the table. 

"Yeah, I'll write my autobiography if anybody ever gives me a chance," he 
said. "How can I concentrate on serious work when this is the sort of thing I 
have to do?" He jerked his head at the stove. 

"Friends, huh! Those people think that just because they took me in, they 
can exploit me like a Chinese coolie! Just because I had no other place to 
go. They have it easy, those good old friends of mine. He never lifts a 
finger around the house, just sits in his store all day; a lousy little two- 
bit stationery store— can it compare in importance with the book I'm writing? 
And she goes out shopping and asks me to watch her damn stew for her. She 
knows that a writer needs peace and concentration, but does she care about 
that? Do you know what she did today?" He leaned confidentially across the 
table, pointing at the dishes in the sink. "She went to the market and left 
all the breakfast dishes there and said she'd do them later. I know what she 



wanted. She expected me to do them. Well, I'll fool her. I'll leave them just 
where they are." 

"Would you allow me to ask you a few questions about the motor factory?" 

"Don't imagine that that motor factory was the only thing in my life. 

I'd held many important positions before. I was prominently connected, at 
various times, with enterprises manufacturing surgical appliances, paper 
containers, men's hats and vacuum cleaners. Of course, that sort of stuff 
didn't give me much scope. But the motor factory— that was my big chance. That 
was what I'd been waiting for." 

"How did you happen to acquire it?" 

"It was meant for me. It was my dream come true. The factory was 'shut 
down— bankrupt . The heirs of Jed Starnes had run it into the ground pretty 
fast. I don't know exactly what it was, but there had been something goofy 
going on up there, so the company went broke. The railroad people closed 
their branch line. Nobody wanted the place, nobody would bid on it. But there 
it was, this great factory, with all the equipment, all the machinery, all 
the things that had made millions for Jed Starnes. That was the kind of setup 
I wanted, the kind of opportunity I was entitled to. So I got a few friends 
together and we formed the Amalgamated Service Corporation and we scraped up 
a little money. But we didn't have enough, we needed a loan to help us out 
and give us a start. It was a perfectly safe bet, we were young men embarking 
on great careers, full of eagerness and hope for the future. 

But do you think anybody gave us any encouragement? They did not. 

Not those greedy, entrenched vultures of privilege! How were we to succeed 
in life if nobody would give us a factory? We couldn't compete against the 
little snots who inherit whole chains of factories, could we? 

Weren't we entitled to the same break? Aw, don't let me hear anything 
about justice! I worked like a dog, trying to get somebody to lend us the 
money. But that bastard Midas Mulligan put me through the wringer." 

She sat up straight. "Midas Mulligan?" 

"Yeah— the banker who looked like a truck driver and acted it, too!" 
"Did you know Midas Mulligan?" 

"Did I know him? I'm the only man who ever beat him— not that it did me any 
good ! " 

At odd moments, with a sudden sense of uneasiness, she had wondered— as she 
wondered about the stories of deserted ships found floating at sea or of 
sourceless lights flashing in the sky— about the disappearance of Midas 
Mulligan. There was no reason why she felt that she had to solve these 
riddles, except that they were mysteries which had no business being 
mysteries: they could not be causeless, yet no known cause could explain 
them. 

Midas Mulligan had once been the richest and, consequently, the most 
denounced man in the country. He had never taken a loss on any investment he 
made; everything he touched turned into gold. "It's because I know what to 
touch," he said. Nobody could grasp the pattern of his investments: he 
rejected deals that were considered flawlessly safe, and he put enormous 
amounts into ventures that no other banker would handle. Through the years, 
he had been the trigger that had sent unexpected, spectacular bullets of 
industrial success shooting over the country. It was he who had invested in 
Rearden Steel at its start, thus helping Rearden to complete the purchase of 
the abandoned steel mills in Pennsylvania. When an economist referred to him 
once as an audacious gambler, Mulligan said, "The reason why you'll never get 
rich is because you think that what I do is gambling." 

It was rumored that one had to observe a certain unwritten rule when 
dealing with Midas Mulligan: if an applicant for a loan ever mentioned his 
personal need or any personal feeling whatever, the interview ended and he 
was never given another chance to speak to Mr. Mulligan. 



"Why yes, I can," said Midas Mulligan, when he was asked whether he could 
name a person more evil than the man with a heart closed to pity. "The man 
who uses another's pity for him as a weapon." 

In his long career, he had ignored all the public attacks on him, except 
one. His first name had been Michael; when a newspaper columnist of the 
humanitarian clique nicknamed him Midas Mulligan and the tag stuck to him as 
an insult, Mulligan appeared in court and petitioned for a legal change of 
his first name to "Midas." The petition was granted. 

In the eyes of his contemporaries, he was a man who had committed the one 
unforgivable sin: he was proud of his wealth. 

These were the things Dagny had heard about Midas Mulligan; she had never 
met him. Seven years ago, Midas Mulligan had vanished. 

He left his home one morning and was never heard from again. On the next 
day, the depositors of the Mulligan Bank in Chicago received notices 
requesting that they withdraw their funds, because the bank was closing. In 
the investigations that followed, it was learned that Mulligan had planned 
the closing in advance and in minute detail; his employees were merely 
carrying out his instructions. It was the most orderly run on a bank that the 
country ever witnessed. Every depositor received his money down to the last 
fraction of interest due. All of the bank's assets had been sold piecemeal to 
various financial institutions. When the books were balanced, it was found 
that they balanced perfectly, to the penny; nothing was left over; the 
Mulligan Bank had been wiped out. 

No clue was ever found to Mulligan's motive, to his personal fate or to 
the many millions of his personal fortune. The man and the fortune vanished 
as if they had never existed. No one had had any warning about his decision, 
and no events could be traced to explain it. If he had wished to retire- 
people wondered— why hadn't he sold his establishment at a huge profit, as he 
could have done, instead of destroying it? There was nobody to give an 
answer. He had no family, no friends. 

His servants knew nothing: he had left his home that morning as usual and 
did not come back; that was all. 

There was— Dagny had thought uneasily for years— a quality of the impossible 
about Mulligan's disappearance; it was as if a New York skyscraper had 
vanished one night, leaving nothing behind but a vacant lot on a street 
corner. A man like Mulligan, and a fortune such as he had taken along with 
him, could not stay hidden anywhere; a skyscraper could not get lost, it 
would be seen rising above any plain or forest chosen for its hiding place; 
were it destroyed, even its pile of rubble could not remain unnoticed. But 
Mulligan had gone— and in the seven years since, in the mass of rumors, 
guesses, theories, Sunday supplement stories, and eyewitnesses who claimed to 
have seen him in every part of the world, no clue to a plausible explanation 
had ever been discovered. 

Among the stories, there was one so preposterously out of character that 
Dagny believed it to be true: nothing in Mulligan's nature could have given 
anyone ground to invent it. It was said that the last person to see him, on 
the spring morning of his disappearance, was an old woman who sold flowers on 
a Chicago street corner by the Mulligan Bank. She related that he stopped and 
bought a bunch of the year's first bluebells. His face was the happiest face 
she had ever seen; he had the look of a youth starting out into a great, 
unobstructed vision of life lying open before him; the marks of pain and 
tension, the sediment of years upon a human face, had been wiped off, and 
what remained was only joyous eagerness and peace. He picked up the flowers 
as if on a sudden impulse, and he winked at the old woman, as if he had some 
shining joke to share with her. He said, "Do you know how much I've always 
loved it— being alive?" She stared at him, bewildered, and he walked away, 
tossing the flowers like a ball in his hand— a broad, straight figure in a 



sedate, expensive, businessman's overcoat, going off into the distance 
against the straight cliffs of office buildings with the spring sun sparkling 
on their windows. 

"Midas Mulligan was a vicious bastard with a dollar sign stamped on his 
heart," said Lee Hunsacker, in the fumes of the acrid stew. "My whole future 
depended upon a miserable half-million dollars, which was just small change 
to him, bat when I applied for a loan, he turned me down flat— for no better 
reason than that I had no collateral to offer. 

How could I have accumulated any collateral, when nobody had ever given me 
a chance at anything big? Why did he lend money to others, but not to me? It 
was plain discrimination. He didn't even care about my feelings— he said that 
my past record of failures disqualified me for ownership of a vegetable 
pushcart, let alone a motor factory. What failures? I couldn't help it if a 
lot of ignorant grocers refused to co-operate with me about the paper 
containers. By what right did he pass judgment on my ability? Why did my 
plans for my own future have to depend upon the arbitrary opinion of a 
selfish monopolist? I wasn't going to stand for that. I wasn't going to take 
it lying down. I brought suit against him." 

"You did what?" 

"Oh yes," he said proudly, "I brought suit. I'm sure it would seem strange 
in some of your hidebound Eastern states, but the state of Illinois had a 
very humane, very progressive law under which I could sue him. I must say it 
was the first case of its kind, but I had a very smart, liberal lawyer who 
saw a way for us to do it. It was an economic emergency law which said that 
people were forbidden to discriminate for any reason whatever against any 
person in any matter involving his livelihood. It was used to protect day 
laborers and such, but it applied to me and my partners as well, didn't it? 
So we went to court, and we testified about the bad breaks we'd all had in 
the past, and I quoted Mulligan saying that I couldn't even own a vegetable 
pushcart, and we proved that all the members of the Amalgamated Service 
corporation had no prestige, no credit, no way to make a living —and, 
therefore, the purchase of the motor factory was our only chance of 
livelihood— and, therefore, Midas Mulligan had no right to discriminate 
against us— and, therefore, we were entitled to demand a loan from him under 
the law. Oh, we had a perfect case all right, but the man who presided at the 
trial was Judge Narragansett, one of those old-fashioned monks of the bench 
who thinks like a mathematician and never feels the human side of anything. 
He just sat there all through the trial like a marble statue— like one of 
those blindfolded marble statues, At the end, he instructed the jury to bring 
in a verdict in favor of Midas Mulligan— and he said some very harsh things 
about me and my partners. But we appealed to a higher court— and the higher 
court reversed the verdict and ordered Mulligan to give us the loan on our 
terms. He had three months in which to comply, but before the three months 
were up, something happened that nobody can figure out and he vanished into 
thin air, he and his bank. There wasn't an extra penny left of that bank, to 
collect our lawful claim. We wasted a lot of money on detectives, trying to 
find him— as who didn't?— but we gave it up." 

No— thought Dagny— no, apart from the sickening feeling it gave her, this 
case was not much worse than any of the other things that Midas Mulligan had 
borne for years. He had taken many losses under laws of a similar justice, 
under rules and edicts that had cost him much larger sums of money; he had 
borne them and fought and worked the harder; it was not likely that this case 
had broken him. 

"What happened to Judge Narragansett?" she asked involuntarily, and 
wondered what subconscious connection had made her ask it. She knew little 
about Judge Narragansett, but she had heard and remembered his name, because 



it was a name that belonged so exclusively to the North American continent. 
Now she realized suddenly that she had heard nothing about him for years. 

"Oh, he retired," said Lee Hunsacker. 

"He did?" The question was almost a gasp. 

"Yeah. " 

"When?" 

"Oh, about six months later." 
"What did he do after he retired?" 

"I don't know. I don't think anybody's heard from him since." 

He wondered why she looked frightened. Part of the fear she felt, was that 
she could not name its reason, either. "Please tell me about the motor 
factory," she said with effort. 

"Well, Eugene Lawson of the Community National Bank in Madison finally 
gave us a loan to buy the factory— but he was just a messy cheapskate, he 
didn't have enough money to see us through, he couldn't help us when we went 
bankrupt. It was not our fault. We had everything against us from the start. 
How could we run a factory when we had no railroad? Weren't we entitled to a 
railroad? I tried to get them to reopen their branch line, but those damn 
people at Taggart Trans—" 

He stopped. "Say, are you by any chance one of those Taggarts?" 

"I am the Operating Vice-President of Taggart Transcontinental." 

For a moment, he stared at her in blank stupor; she saw the struggle of 
fear, obsequiousness and hatred in his filmy eyes. The result was a sudden 
snarl: "I don't need any of you big shots! Don't think I'm going to be afraid 
of you. Don't expect me to beg for a job. I'm not asking favors of anybody. I 
bet you're not used to hear people talk to you this way, are you?" 

"Mr. Hunsacker, I will appreciate it very much if you will give me the 
information I need about the factory." 

"You're a little late getting interested. What's the matter? Your 
conscience bothering you? You people let Jed Starnes grow filthy rich on that 
factory, but you wouldn't give us a break. It was the same factory. 

We did everything he did. We started right in manufacturing the particular 
type of motor that had been his biggest money-maker for years. And then some 
newcomer nobody ever heard of opened a two bit factory down in Colorado, by 
the name of Nielsen Motors, and put out a new motor of the same class as the 
Starnes model, at half the price! We couldn't help that, could we? It was all 
right for Jed Starnes, no destructive competitor happened to come up in his 
time, but what were we to do? How could we fight this Nielsen, when nobody 
had given us a motor to compete with his?" 

"Did you take over the Starnes research laboratory?" 

"Yes, yes, it was there. Everything was there." 

"His staff, too?" 

"Oh, some of them. A lot of them had gone while the factory was closed." 
"His research staff?" 
"They were gone." 

"Did you hire any research men of your own?" 

"Yes, yes, some— but let me tell you, I didn't have much money to spend on 
such things as laboratories, when I never had enough funds to give me a 
breathing spell. I couldn't even pay the bills I owed for the absolutely 
essential modernizing and redecorating which I'd had to do —that factory was 
disgracefully old-fashioned from the standpoint of human efficiency. The 
executive offices had bare plaster walls and a dinky little washroom. Any 
modern psychologist will tell you that nobody could do his best in such 
depressing surroundings. I had to have a brighter color scheme in my office, 
and a decent modern bathroom with a stall shower. Furthermore, I spent a lot 
of money on a new cafeteria and a playroom and rest room for the workers. We 
had to have morale, didn't we? Any enlightened person knows that man is made 



by the material factors of his background, and that a man's mind is shaped by 
his tools of production. But people wouldn't wait for the laws of economic 
determinism to operate upon us. We never had a motor factory before. We had 
to let the tools condition our minds, didn't we? But nobody gave us time." 
"Can you tell me about the work of your research staff?" 

"Oh, I had a group of very promising young men, all of them guaranteed by 
diplomas from the best universities. But it didn't do me any good. I don't 
know what they were doing. I think they were just sitting around, eating up 
their salaries." 

"Who was in charge of your laboratory?" 

"Hell, how can I remember that now?" 

"Do you remember any of the names of your research staff?" 
"Do you think I had time to meet every hireling in person?" 
"Did any of them ever mention to you any experiments with a . . . 
with an entirely new kind of motor?" 

"What motor? Let me tell you that an executive of my position does not 
hang around laboratories. I spent most of my time in New York and Chicago, 
trying to raise money to keep us going." 

"Who was the general manager of tie factory?" 

"A very able fellow by the name of Roy Cunningham. He died last year in an 
auto accident. Drunk driving, they said." 

"Can you give me the names and addresses of any of your associates? Anyone 
you remember?" 

"I don't know what's become of them. I wasn't in a mood to keep track of 
that. " 

"Have you preserved any of the factory records?" 
"I certainly have." 

She sat up eagerly. "Would you let me see them?" 
"You bet ! " 

He seemed eager to comply; he rose at once and hurried out of the room. 
What he put down before her, when he returned, was a thick album of 
clippings: it contained his newspaper interviews and his press agent's 
releases . 

"I was one of the big industrialists, too," he said proudly. "I was a 
national figure, as you can see. My life will make a book of deep, human 
significance. I'd have written it long ago, if I had the proper tools of 
production." He banged angrily upon his typewriter. "I can't work on this 
damn thing. It skips spaces. How can I get any inspiration and write a best 
seller with a typewriter that skips spaces?" 

"Thank you, Mr. Hunsacker, " she said. "I believe this is all you can tell 
me." She rose. "You don't happen to know what became of the Starnes heirs?" 

"Oh, they ran for cover after they'd wrecked the factory. There were three 
of them, two sons and a daughter. Last I heard, they were hiding their faces 
out in Durance, Louisiana." 

The last sight she caught of Lee Hunsacker, as she turned to go, was his 
sudden leap to the stove; he seized the lid off the pot and dropped it to the 
floor, scorching his fingers and cursing: the stew was burned. 

Little was left of the Starnes fortune and less of the Starnes heirs. 

"You won't like having to see them, Miss Taggart, " said the chief of 
police of Durance, Louisiana; he was an elderly man with a slow, firm manner 
and a look of bitterness acquired not in blind resentment., but in fidelity 
to clear-cut standards. "There's all sorts of human beings to see in the 
world, there's murderers and criminal maniacs— but, somehow, I think these 
Starnes persons are what decent people shouldn't have to see. They're a bad 
sort, Miss Taggart. Clammy and bad . . . 

Yes, they're still here in town— two of them, that is. The third one is: 
dead. Suicide. That was four years ago. It's an ugly story. He was the 



youngest of the three, Eric Starnes. He was one of those chronic young men 
who go around whining about their sensitive feelings, when they're well past 
forty. He needed love, was his line. He was being kept by older women, when 
he could find them. Then he started running after a girl of sixteen, a nice 
girl who wouldn't have anything to do with him. 

She married a boy she was engaged to. Eric Starnes got into their house on 
the wedding day, and when they came back from church after the ceremony, they 
found him in their bedroom, dead, messy dead, his wrists slashed. . . . Now I 
say there might be forgiveness for a man who kills himself quietly. Who can 
pass judgment on another man's suffering and on the limit of what he can 
bear? But the man who kills himself, making a show of his death in order to 
hurt somebody, the man who gives his life for malice— there ' s no forgiveness 
for him, no excuse, he's rotten clear through, and what he deserves is that 
people spit at his memory, instead of feeling sorry for him and hurt, as he 
wanted them to be. . . . Well, that was Eric Starnes. I can tell you where to 
find the other two, if you wish." 

She found Gerald Starnes in the ward of a flophouse. He lay half twisted 
on a cot. His hair was still black, but the white stubble of his chin was 
like a mist of dead weeds over a vacant face. He was soggy drunk. A pointless 
chuckle kept breaking his voice when he spoke, the sound of a static, 
unfocused malevolence, "It went bust, the great factory. That's what happened 
to it. Just went up and bust. Does that bother you, madam? The factory was 
rotten. Everybody is rotten. I'm supposed to beg somebody's pardon, but I 
won't. I don't give a damn. People get fits trying to keep up the show, when 
it's all rot, black rot, the automobiles, the buildings and the souls, and it 
doesn't make any difference, one way or another. You should've seen the kind 
of literati who turned flip-flops when I whistled, when I had the dough. The 
professors, the poets, the intellectuals, the world-savers and the brother- 
lovers. Any way I whistled. I had lots of fun. I wanted to do good, but now I 
don't. There isn't any good. Not any goddamn good in the whole goddamn 
universe. I don't propose to take a bath if I don't feel like it, and that's 
that. If you want to know anything about the factory, ask my sister. My sweet 
sister who had a trust fund they couldn't touch, so she got out of it safe, 
even if she's in the hamburger class now, not the filet mignon a la Sauce 
Bearnaise, but would she give a penny of it to her brother? The noble plan 
that busted was her idea as much as mine, but will she give me a penny? 

Hah! Go take a look at the duchess, take a look. What do I care about the 
factory? It was just a pile of greasy machinery. I'll sell you all my rights, 
claims and title to it— for a drink. I'm the last of the Starnes name. It used 
to be a great name— Starnes . I'll sell it to you. You think I'm a stinking 
bum, but that goes for all the rest of them and for rich ladies like you, 
too. I wanted to do good for humanity. Hah! I wish they'd all boil in oil. Be 
lots of fun. I wish they'd choke. What does it matter? What does anything 
matter?" 

On the next cot, a white-haired, shriveled little tramp turned in his 
sleep, moaning; a nickel clattered to the floor out of his rags. Gerald 
Starnes picked it up and slipped it into his own pocket. He glanced at Dagny. 
The creases of his face were a malignant smile. 

"Want to wake him up and start trouble?" he asked. "If you do, I'll say 
that you're lying." 

The ill-smelling bungalow, where she found Ivy Starnes, stood on the edge 
of town, by the shore of the Mississippi. Hanging strands of moss and clots 
of waxy foliage made the thick vegetation look as if it were drooling; the 
too many draperies, hanging in the stagnant air of a small room, had the same 
look. The smell came from undusted corners and from incense burning in silver 
jars at the feet of contorted Oriental deities. Ivy Starnes sat on a pillow 
like a baggy Buddha. Her mouth was a tight little crescent, the petulant 



mouth of a child demanding adulation— on the spreading, pallid face of a woman 
past fifty. Her eyes were two lifeless puddles of water. Her voice had the 
even, dripping monotone of rain: "I can't answer the kind of questions you're 
asking, my girl. The research laboratory? The engineers? Why should I 
remember anything about them? It was my father who was concerned with such 
matters, not I, My father was an evil man who cared for nothing but business. 

He had no time for love, only for money. My brothers and I lived on a 
different plane. Our aim was not to produce gadgets, but to do good. 

We brought a great, new plan into the factory. It was eleven years ago. 

We were defeated by the greed, the selfishness and the base, animal nature 
of men. It was the eternal conflict between spirit and matter, between soul 
and body. They would not renounce their bodies, which was all we asked of 
them. I do not remember any of those men. I do not care to remember. . . . 
The engineers? I believe it was they who started the hemophilia. . . . Yes, 
that is what I said: the hemophilia— 

the slow leak— the loss of blood that cannot be stopped. They ran first. 

They deserted us, one after another . . . Our plan? We put into practice 
that noble historical precept: From each according to his ability, to each 
according to his need. Everybody in the factory, from charwomen to president, 
received the same salary— the barest minimum necessary. 

Twice a year, we all gathered in a mass meeting, where every person 
presented his claim for what he believed to be his needs. We voted on every 
claim, and the will of the majority established every person's need and every 
person's ability. The income of the factory was distributed accordingly. 
Rewards were based on need, and penalties on ability. Those whose needs were 
voted to be the greatest, received the most. Those who had not produced as 
much as the vote said they could, were fined and had to pay the fines by 
working overtime without pay. 

That was our plan. It was based on the principle of selflessness. It 
required men to be motivated, not by personal gain, but by love for their 
brothers . " 

Dagny heard a cold, implacable voice saying somewhere within her: Remember 
it— remember it well— it is not often that one can see pure evil— look at it- 
remember— and some day you'll find the words to name its essence. . . . She 
heard it through the screaming of other voices that cried in helpless 
violence: It's nothing— I've heard it before —I'm hearing it everywhere— it ' s 
nothing but the same old tripe- 
why can't I stand it?— I can't stand it— I can't stand it! 

"What's the matter with you, my girl? Why did you jump up like that? Why 
are you shaking? . . . What? Do speak louder, I can't hear you. . . . How did 
the plan work out? I do not care to discuss it. 

Things became very ugly indeed and went fouler every year. It has cost me 
my faith in human nature. In four years, a plan conceived, not by the cold 
calculations of the mind, but by the pure love of the heart, was brought to 
an end in the sordid mess of policemen, lawyers and bankruptcy proceedings. 
But I have seen my error and I am free of it, I am through with the world of 
machines, manufacturers and money, the world enslaved by matter. I am 
learning the emancipation of the spirit, as revealed in the great secrets of 
India, the release from bondage to flesh, the victory over physical nature, 
the triumph of the spirit over matter." 

Through the blinding white glare of anger, Dagny was seeing a long strip 
of concrete that had been a road, with weeds rising from its cracks, and the 
figure of a man contorted by a hand plow. 

"But, my girl, I said that I do not remember. . . . But I do not know 
their names, I do not know any names, I do not know what sort of adventurers 
my father may have had in that laboratory! . . . 



Don't you hear me? ... I am not accustomed to being questioned in such 
manner and . . . Don't keep repeating it. Don't you know any words but 
'engineer'? . . . Don't you hear me at all? . . . What's the matter with you? 
I— I don't like your face, you're . . . Leave me alone. I don't know who you 
are, I've never hurt you, I'm an old woman, don't look at me like that, I . . 
. Stand back! Don't come near me or I'll call for help! I'll . . . Oh, yes, 
yes, I know that one! 

The chief engineer. Yes. He was the head of the laboratory. Yes. 

William Hastings. That was his name— William Hastings. I remember. 

He went off to Brandon, Wyoming. He quit the day after we introduced the 
plan. He was the second man to quit us. . . .No. No, I don't remember who 
was the first. He wasn't anybody important." 

The woman who opened the door had graying hair and a poised, distinguished 
look of grooming; it took Dagny a few seconds to realize that her garment was 
only a simple cotton housedress, "May I see Mr. William Hastings?" asked 
Dagny . 

The woman looked at her for the briefest instant of a pause; it was an odd 
glance, inquiring and grave. "May I ask your name?" 

"I am Dagny Taggart, of Taggart Transcontinental." 

"Oh. Please come in, Miss Taggart. I am Mrs. William Hastings." 

The measured tone of gravity went through every syllable of her voice, 
like a warning. Her manner was courteous, but she did not smile. 

It was a modest home in the suburbs of an industrial town. Bare tree 
branches cut across the bright, cold blue of the sky, on the top of the rise 
that led to the house. The walls of the living room were silver-gray; 
sunlight hit the crystal stand of a lamp with a white shade; beyond an open 
door, a breakfast nook was papered in red-dotted white. 

"Were you acquainted with my husband in business, Miss Taggart?" 

"No. I have never met Mr. Hastings. But I should like to speak to him on a 
matter of business of crucial importance." 

"My husband died five years ago, Miss Taggart." 

Dagny closed her eyes; the dull, sinking shock contained the conclusions 
she did not have to make in words: This, then, had been the man she was 
seeking, and Rearden had been right; this was why the motor had been left 
unclaimed on a junk pile. 

"I'm sorry," she said, both to Mrs. Hastings and to herself. 

The suggestion of a smile on Mrs. Hastings' face held sadness, but the 
face had no imprint of tragedy, only a grave look of firmness, acceptance and 
quiet serenity. 

"Mrs. Hastings, would you permit me to ask you a few questions?" 
"Certainly. Please sit down." 

"Did you have some knowledge of your husband's scientific work?" 
"Very little. None, really. He never discussed it at home." 
"He was, at one time, chief engineer of the Twentieth Century Motor 
Company? " 

"Yes. He had been employed by them for eighteen years." 

"I wanted to ask Mr. Hastings about his work there and the reason why he 
gave it up. If you can tell me, I would like to know what happened in that 
factory . " 

The smile of sadness and humor appeared fully on Mrs. Hastings' 

face. "That is what I would like to know myself," she said. "But I'm 
afraid I shall never learn it now. I know why he left the factory. It was 
because of an outrageous scheme which the heirs of led Starnes established 
there. He would not work on such terms or for such people. 

But there was something else. I've always felt that something happened at 
Twentieth Century Motors, which he would not tell me." 

"I'm extremely anxious to know any clue you may care to give me." 



"I have no clue to it. I've tried to guess and given up. I cannot 
understand or explain it. But I know that something happened. 

When my husband left Twentieth Century, we came here and he took a job as 
head of the engineering department of Acme Motors. It was a growing, 
successful concern at the time. It gave my husband the kind of work he liked. 
He was not a person prone to inner conflicts, he had always been sure of his 
actions and at peace with himself. But for a whole year after we left 
Wisconsin, he acted as if he were tortured by something, as if he were 
struggling with a personal problem he could not solve. At the end of that 
year, he came to me one morning and told me that he had resigned from Acme 
Motors, that he was retiring and would not work anywhere else. He loved his 
work; it was his whole life. Yet he looked calm, self-confident and happy, 
for the first time since we'd come here. He asked me not to question him 
about the reason of his decision. I didn't question him and I didn't object. 
We had this house, we had our savings, we had enough to live on modestly for 
the rest of our days. I never learned his reason. We went on living here, 
quietly and very happily. He seemed to feel a profound contentment. He had an 
odd serenity of spirit that I had never seen in him before. There was nothing 
strange in his behavior or activity— except that at times, Very rarely, he 
went out without telling me where he went or whom he saw. In the last two 
years of his life, he went away for one month, each summer; he did not tell 
me where. Otherwise, he lived as he always had. He studied a great deal and 
he spent his time on engineering research of his own, working in the basement 
of our house. I don't know what he did with his notes and experimental 
models. I found no trace of them in the basement, after his death. 

He died five years ago, of a heart ailment from which he had suffered for 
some time." 

Dagny asked hopelessly, "Did you know the nature of his experiments?" 
"No. I know very little about engineering." 

"Did you know any of his professional friends or co-workers, who might 
have been acquainted with his research?" 

"No. When he was at Twentieth Century Motors, he worked such long hours 
that we had very little time for ourselves and we spent it together. We had 
no social life at all. He never brought his associates to the house." 

"When he was at Twentieth Century, did he ever mention to you a motor he 
had designed, an entirely new type of motor that could have changed the 
course of all industry?" 

"A motor? Yes. Yes, he spoke of it several times. He said it was an 
invention of incalculable importance. But it was not he who had designed it. 
It was the invention of a young assistant of his." 

She saw the expression on Dagny 's face, and added slowly, quizzically, 
without reproach, merely in sad amusement, "I see." 

"Oh, I'm sorry!" said Dagny, realizing that her emotion had shot to her 
face and become a smile as obvious as a cry of relief. 

"It's quite all right. I understand. It's the inventor of that motor that 
you're interested in. I don't know whether he is still alive, but at least I 
have no reason to think that he isn't." 

"I'd give half my life to know that he is— and to find him. It's as 
important as that, Mrs. Hastings. Who is he?" 

"I don't know. I don't know his name or anything about him. I never knew 
any of the men on my husband's staff. He told me only that he had a young 
engineer who, some day, would up-turn the world. 

My husband did not care for anything in people except ability. I think 
this was the only man he ever loved. He didn't say so, but I could tell it, 
just by the way he spoke of this young assistant. I remember— the day he told 
me that the motor was completed— how his voice sounded when he said, 'And he's 



only twenty-six! ' This was about a month before the death of Jed Starnes. He 
never mentioned the motor or the young engineer, after that." 

"You don't know what became of the young engineer?" 

"No . " 

"You can't suggest any way to find him?" 
"No . " 

"You have no clue, no lead to help me learn his name?" 
"None. Tell me, was that motor extremely valuable?" 
"More valuable than any estimate I could give you." 

"It's strange, because, you see, I thought of it once, some years after 
we'd left Wisconsin, and I asked my husband what had become of that invention 
he'd said was so great, what would be done with it. 

He looked at me very oddly and answered, 'Nothing.' " 

"Why?" 

"He wouldn't tell me." 

"Can you remember anyone at all who worked at Twentieth Century? Anyone 
who knew that young engineer? Any friend of his?" 

"No, I . . . Wait! Wait, I think I can give you a lead. I can tell you 
where to find one friend of his. I don't even know that friend's name, 
either, but I know his address. It's an odd story. I'd better explain how it 
happened. One evening— about two years after we'd come here— my husband was 
going out and I needed our car that night, so he asked me to pick him up 
after dinner at the restaurant of the railroad station. He did not tell me 
with whom he was having dinner. When I drove up to the station, I saw him 
standing outside the restaurant with two men. One of them was young and tall. 
The other was elderly; he looked very distinguished. I would still recognize 
those men anywhere; they had the kind of faces one doesn't forget. My husband 
saw me and left them. They walked away toward the station platform; there was 
a train coming. My husband pointed after the young man and said, 'Did you see 
him? That's the boy I told you about . 1 'The one who's the great maker of 
motors?' The one who was.' " 

"And he told you nothing else?" 

"Nothing else. This was nine years ago. Last spring, I went to visit my 
brother who lives in Cheyenne. One afternoon, he took the family out for a 
long drive. We went up into pretty wild country, high in the Rockies, and we 
stopped at a roadside diner. There was a distinguished, gray-haired man 
behind the counter. I kept staring at him while he fixed our sandwiches and 
coffee, because I knew that I had seen his face before, but could not 
remember where. We drove on, we were miles away from the diner, when I 
remembered. You'd better go there. 

It's on Route 86, in the mountains, west of Cheyenne, near a small 
industrial settlement by the Lennox Copper Foundry. It seems strange, but I'm 
certain of it: the cook in that diner is the man I saw at the railroad 
station with my husband's young idol." 

The diner stood on the summit of a long, hard climb. Its glass walls 
spread a coat of polish over the view of rocks and pines descending in broken 
ledges to the sunset. It was dark below, but an even, glowing light still 
remained in the diner, as in a small pool left behind by a receding tide. 

Dagny sat at the end of the counter, eating a hamburger sandwich. 

It was the best-cooked food she had ever tasted, the product of simple 
ingredients and of an unusual skill. Two workers were finishing their dinner; 
she was waiting for them to depart. 

She studied the man behind the counter. He was slender and tall; he had an 
air of distinction that belonged in an ancient castle or in the inner office 
of a bank; but his peculiar quality came from the fact that he made the 
distinction seem appropriate here, behind the counter of a diner. He wore a 
cook's white jacket as if it were a full-dress suit. There was an expert 



competence in his manner of working; his movements were easy, intelligently 
economical. He had a lean face and gray hair that blended in tone with the 
cold blue of his eyes; somewhere beyond his look of courteous sternness, 
there was a note of humor, so faint that it vanished if one tried to discern 
it. 

The two workers finished, paid and departed, each leaving a dime for a 
tip. She watched the man as he removed their dishes, put the dimes into the 
pocket of his white jacket, wiped the counter, working with swift precision. 
Then he turned and looked at her. It was an impersonal glance, not intended 
to invite conversation; but she felt certain that he had long since noted her 
New York suit, her high-heeled pumps, her air of being a woman who did not 
waste her time; his cold, observant eyes seemed to tell her that he knew she 
did not belong here and that he was waiting to discover her purpose. 

"How is business?" she asked. 

"Pretty bad. They're going to close the Lennox Foundry next week, so I'll 
have to close soon, too, and move on." His voice was clear, impersonally 
cordial . 

"Where to?" 

"1 haven't decided." 

"What sort of thing do you have in mind?" 

"I don't know. I'm thinking of opening a garage, if I can find the right 
spot in some town." 

"Oh no! You're too good at your job to change it. You shouldn't want to be 
anything but a cook." 

A strange, fine smile moved the curve of his mouth. "No?" he asked 
courteously . 

"No! How would you like a job in New York?" He looked at her, astonished. 
"I'm serious. I can give you a job on a big railroad, in charge of the 
dining-car department." 

"May I ask why you should want to?" 

She raised the hamburger sandwich in its white paper napkin. 
"There's one of the reasons." 
"Thank you. What are the others?" 

'T don't suppose you've lived in a big city, or you'd know how miserably 
difficult it is to find any competent men for any job whatever." 
"I know a little about that." 

"Well? How about it, then? Would you like a job in New York at ten 
thousand dollars a year?" 
"No. " 

She had been carried away by the joy of discovering and rewarding ability. 
She looked at him silently, shocked. "I don't think you understood me," she 
said. 

"I did." 

"You're refusing an opportunity of this kind?" 
"Yes . " 
"But why?" 

"That is a personal matter." 

"Why should you work like this, when you can have a better job?" 

"I am not looking for a better job." 

"You don't want a chance to rise and make money?" 

"No. Why do you insist?" 

"Because I hate to see ability being wasted!" 
He said slowly, intently, "So do I." 

Something in the way he said it made her feel the bond of some profound 
emotion which they held in common; it broke the discipline that forbade her 
ever to call for help. "I'm so sick of them!" Her voice startled hen it was 



an involuntary cry. "I'm so hungry for any sight of anyone who's able to do 
whatever it is he's doing!" 

She pressed the back of her hand to her eyes, trying to dam the outbreak 
of a despair she had not permitted herself to acknowledge; she had not known 
the extent of it, nor how little of her endurance the quest had left her. 

"I'm sorry," he said, his voice low. It sounded, not as an apology, but as 
a statement of compassion. 

She glanced up at him. He smiled, and she knew that the smile was intended 
to break the bond which he, too, had felt: the smile had a trace of courteous 
mockery. He said, "But I don't believe that you came all the way from New 
York just to hunt for railroad cooks in the Rockies." 

"No. I came for something else." She leaned forward, both forearms braced 
firmly against the counter, feeling calm and in tight control again, sensing 
a dangerous adversary. "Did you know, about ten years ago, a young engineer 
who worked for the Twentieth Century Motor Company?" 

She counted the seconds of a pause; she could not define the nature of the 
way he looked at her, except that it was the look of some special 
attentiveness . 

"Yes, I did, " he answered. 

"Could you give me his name and address?" 

"What for?" 

"It's crucially important that I find him." 
"That man? Of what importance is he?" 
"He is the most important man in the world." 
"Really? Why?" 

"Did you know anything about his work?" 
"Yes." 

"Did you know that he hit upon an idea of the most tremendous 
consequence?" 

He let a moment pass. "May I ask who you are?" 
"Dagny Taggart. I'm the Vice-Pres— " 
"Yes, Miss Taggart. I know who you are." 

He said it with impersonal deference. But he looked as if he had found the 
answer to some special question in his mind and was not astonished any 
longer . 

"Then you know that my interest is not idle," she said. "I'm in a position 
to give him the chance he needs and I'm prepared to pay anything he asks." 
"May I ask what has aroused your interest in him?" 
"His motor . " 

"How did you happen to know about his motor?" 

"I found a broken remnant of it in the ruins of the Twentieth Century 
factory. Not enough to reconstruct it or to learn how it worked, But enough 
to know that it did work and that it's an invention which can save my 
railroad, the country and the economy of the whole world. 

Don't ask me to tell you now what trail I've followed, trying to trace 
that motor and to find its inventor. That's not of any importance, even my 
life and work are not of any importance to me right now, nothing is of any 
importance, except that I must find him. Don't ask me how I happened to come 
to you. You're the end of the trail. Tell me his name." 

He had listened without moving, looking straight at her; the attentiveness 
of his eyes seemed to take hold of every word and store it carefully away, 
giving her no clue to his purpose. He did not move for a long time. Then he 
said, "Give it up, Miss Taggart. You won't find him." 

"What is his name?" 

"I can tell you nothing about him." 

"Is he still alive?" 

"I can tell you nothing." 



"What is your name?" 
"Hugh Akston." 

Through the blank seconds of recapturing her mind, she kept telling 
herself: You're hysterical . . . don't be preposterous . . . it's just a 
coincidence of names— while she knew, in certainty and numb, inexplicable 
terror, that this was the Hugh Akston. 

"Hugh Akston?" she stammered. "The philosopher? . . . The last of the 
advocates of reason?" 

"Why, yes," he answered pleasantly. "Or the first of their return." 

He did not seem startled by her shock, but he seemed to find it 
unnecessary. His manner was simple, almost friendly, as if he felt no need to 
hide his identity and no resentment at its being discovered. 

"I didn't think that any young person would recognize my name or attach 
any significance to it, nowadays," he said. 

"But . . . but what are you doing here?" Her arm swept at the room. "This 
doesn't make sense!" 

"Are you sure?" 

"What is it? A stunt? An experiment? A secret mission? Are you studying 
something for some special purpose?" 

"No, Miss Taggart. I'm earning my living." The words and the voice had the 
genuine simplicity of truth, "Dr. Akston, I . . .it's inconceivable, it's . 
. . You're . . . you're a philosopher . . . the greatest philosopher living . 
. . an immortal name . . . why would you do this?" 

"Because I am a philosopher, Miss Taggart." 

She knew with certainty— even though she felt as if her capacity for 
certainty and for understanding were gone— that she would obtain no help from 
him, that questions were useless, that he would give her no explanation, 
neither of the inventor's fate nor of his own. 

"Give it up, Miss Taggart, " he said quietly, as if giving proof that he 
could guess her thoughts, as she had known he would. "It is a hopeless quest, 
the more hopeless because you have no inkling of what an impossible task you 
have chosen to undertake. I would like to spare you the strain of trying to 
devise some argument, trick or plea that would make me give you the 
information you are seeking. Take my word for it: it can't be done. You said 
I'm the end of your trail. It's a blind alley, Miss Taggart, Do not attempt 
to waste your money and effort on other, more conventional methods of 
inquiry: do not hire detectives. They will learn nothing. You may choose to 
ignore my warning, but I think that you are a person of high intelligence, 
able to know that I know what I am saying. Give it up. The secret you are 
trying to solve involves something greater— much greater— than the invention of 
a motor run by atmospheric electricity. There is only one helpful suggestion 
that I can give you: By the essence and nature of existence, contradictions 
cannot exist. If you find it inconceivable that an invention of genius should 
be abandoned among ruins, and that a philosopher should wish to work as a 
cook in a diner— check your premises. You will find that one of them is 
wrong . " 

She started: she remembered that she had heard this before and that it was 
Francisco who had said it. And then she remembered that this man had been one 
of Francisco's teachers. 

"As you wish, Dr. Akston," she said. "I won't attempt to question you 
about it. But would you permit me to ask you a question on an entirely 
different subject?" 

"Certainly. " 

"Dr. Robert Stadler once told me that when you were at the Patrick Henry 
University, you had three students who were your favorites and his, three 
brilliant minds from whom you expected a great future. One of them was 
Francisco d'Anconia." 



"Yes. Another was Ragnar Danneskj old . " 

" Incidentally— this is not my question— who was the third?" 
"His name would mean nothing to you. He is not famous." 

"Dr. Stadler said that you and he were rivals over these three students, 
because you both regarded them as your sons." 
"Rivals? He lost them." 

"Tell me, are you proud of the way these three have turned out?" 

He looked off, into the distance, at the dying fire of the sunset on the 
farthest rocks; his face had the look of a father who watches his sons 
bleeding on a battlefield. He answered: "More proud than I had ever hoped to 
be, " 

It was almost dark. He turned sharply, took a package of cigarettes from 
his pocket, pulled out one cigarette, but stopped, remembering her presence, 
as if he had forgotten it for a moment, and extended the package to her. She 
took a cigarette and he struck the brief flare of a match, then shook it out, 
leaving only two small points of fire in the darkness of a glass room and of 
miles of mountains beyond it. 

She rose, paid her bill, and said, "Thank you, Dr. Akston. I will not 
molest you with tricks or pleas. I will not hire detectives. But I think I 
should tell you that I will not give up, I must find the inventor of that 
motor. I will find him." 

"Not until the day when he chooses to find you— as he will." 

When she walked to her car, he switched on the lights in the diner, she 
saw the mailbox by the side of the road and noted the incredible fact that 
the name "Hugh Akston" stood written openly across it. 

She had driven far down the winding road, and the lights of the diner were 
long since out of sight, when she noticed that she was enjoying the taste of 
the cigarette he had given her: it was different from any she had ever smoked 
before. She held the small remnant to the light of the dashboard, looking for 
the name of the brand. There was no name, only a trademark. Stamped in gold 
on the thin, white paper there stood the sign of the dollar. 

She examined it curiously: she had never heard of that brand before. 

Then she remembered the old man at the cigar stand of the Taggart 
Terminal, and smiled, thinking that this was a specimen for his collection. 
She stamped out the fire and dropped the butt into her handbag. 

Train Number 57 was lined along the track, ready to leave for Wyatt 
Junction, when she reached Cheyenne, left her car at the garage where she had 
rented it, and walked out on the platform of the Taggart station. She had 
half an hour to wait for the eastbound main liner to New York. She walked to 
the end of the platform and leaned wearily against a lamppost; she did not 
want to be seen and recognized by the station employees, she did not want to 
talk to anyone, she needed rest. A few people stood in clusters on the half- 
deserted platform; animated conversations seemed to be going on, and 
newspapers were more prominently in evidence than usual. 

She looked at the lighted windows of Train Number 57— for a moment's relief 
in the sight of a victorious achievement. Train Number 57 was about to start 
down the track of the John Gait Line, through the towns, through the curves 
of the mountains, past the green signals where people had stood cheering and 
the valleys where rockets had risen to the summer sky. Twisted remnants of 
leaves now hung on the branches beyond the train's roof line, and the 
passengers wore furs and mufflers, as they climbed aboard. They moved with 
the casual manner of a daily event, with the security of expecting a 
performance long since taken for granted. . . . We've done it— she thought— 
this much, at least, is done. 

It was the chance conversation of two men somewhere behind her that came 
beating suddenly against her closed attention. 

"But laws shouldn't be passed that way, so quickly." 



"They're not laws, they're directives." 
"Then it's illegal." 

"It's not illegal, because the Legislature passed a law last month giving 
him the power to issue directives." 

"I don't think directives should be sprung on people that way, out of the 
blue, like a punch in the nose." 

"Well, there's no time to palaver when it's a national emergency." 

"But I don't think it's right and it doesn't jibe. How is Rearden going to 
do it, when it says here—" 

"Why should you worry about Rearden? He's rich enough. He can find a way 
to do anything." 

Then she leaped to the first newsstand in sight and seized a copy of the 
evening paper. 

It was on the front page. Wesley Mouch, Top Co-ordinator of the Bureau of 
Economic Planning and National Resources, "in a surprise move," said the 
paper, "and in the name of the national emergency, " 

had issued a set of directives, which were strung in a column down the 
page: The railroads of the country were ordered to reduce the maximum speed 
of all trains to sixty miles per hour— to reduce the maximum length of all 
trains to sixty cars— and to run the same number of trains in every state of a 
zone composed of five neighboring states, the country being divided into such 
zones for the purpose. 

The steel mills of the country were ordered to limit the maximum 
production of any metal alloy to an amount equal to the production of other 
metal alloys by other mills placed in the same classification of plant 
capacity— and to supply a fair share of any metal alloy to all consumers who 
might desire to obtain it. 

All the manufacturing establishments of the country, of any size and 
nature, were forbidden to move from their present locations, except when 
granted a special permission to do so by the Bureau of Economic Planning and 
National Resources. 

To compensate the railroads of the country for the extra costs involved 
and "to cushion the process of readjustment," a moratorium on payments of 
interest and principal on all railroad bonds— secured and unsecured, 
convertible and non-convertible— was declared for a period of five years. 

To provide the funds for the personnel to enforce these directives, a 
special tax was imposed on the state of Colorado, "as the state best able to 
assist the needier states to bear the brunt of the national emergency, " such 
tax to consist of five per cent of the gross sales of Colorado's industrial 
concerns . 

The cry she uttered was one she had never permitted herself before, 
because she made it her pride always to answer it herself— but she saw a man 
standing a few steps away, she did not see that he was a ragged bum, and she 
uttered the cry because it was the plea of reason and he was a human figure: 
"What are we going to do?" 

The bum grinned mirthlessly and shrugged: "Who is John Gait?" 

It was not Taggart Transcontinental that stood as the focus of terror in 
her mind, it was not the thought of Hank Rearden tied to a rack pulled in 
opposite directions— it was Ellis Wyatt. Wiping out the rest, filling her 
consciousness, leaving no room for words, no time for wonder, as a glaring 
answer to the questions she had not begun to ask, stood two pictures: Ellis 
Wyatt ' s implacable figure in front of her desk, saying, "It is now in your 
power to destroy me; I may have to go; but if I go, I'll make sure that I 
take all the rest of you along with me"— 

and the circling violence of Ellis Wyatt ' s body when he flung a glass to 
shatter against the wall. 



The only consciousness the pictures left her was the feeling of the 
approach of some unthinkable disaster, and the feeling that she had to outrun 
it. She had to reach Ellis Wyatt and stop him. She did not know what it was 
that she had to prevent. She knew only that she had to stop him. 

And because, were she lying crushed under the ruins of a building, were 
she torn by the bomb of an air raid, so long as she was still in existence 
she would know that action is man's foremost obligation, regardless of 
anything he feels— she was able to run down the platform and to see the face 
of the stationmaster when she found him— she was able to order: "Hold Number 
57 for me ! "—then to run to the privacy of a telephone booth in the darkness 
beyond the end of the platform, and to give the long-distance operator the 
number of Ellis Wyatt ' s house. 

She stood, propped up by the walls of the booth, her eyes closed, and 
listened to the dead whirl of metal which was the sound of a bell ringing 
somewhere. It brought no answer. The bell kept coming in sudden spasms, like 
a drill going through her ear, through her body. 

She clutched the receiver as if, unheeded, it were still a form of 
contact . 

She wished the bell were louder. She forgot that the sound she heard was 
not the one ringing in his house. She did not know that she was screaming, 
"Ellis, don't! Don't! Don't I"— until she heard the cold, reproving voice of 
the operator say, "Your party does not answer." 

She sat at the window of a coach of Train Number 57, and listened to the 
clicking of the wheels on the rails of Rearden Metal, She sat, unresisting, 
swaying with the motion of the train. The black luster of the window hid the 
countryside she did not want to see. It was her second run on the John Gait 
Line, and she tried not to think of the first. 

The bondholders, she thought, the bondholders of the John Gait Line— it was 
to her honor that they had entrusted their money, the saving and achievement 
of years, it was on her ability that they had staked it, it was on her work 
that they had relied and on their own— 

and she had been made to betray them into a looters' trap: there would be 
no trains and no life-blood of freight, the John Gait Line had been only a 
drainpipe that had permitted Jim Taggart to make a deal and to drain their 
wealth, unearned, into his pocket, in exchange for letting others drain his 
railroad— the bonds of the John Gait Line, which, this morning, had been the 
proud guardians of their owners' security and future, had become in the space 
of an hour, scraps of paper that no one would buy, with no value, no future, 
no power, save the power to close the doors and stop the wheels of the last 
hope of the country— 

and Taggart Transcontinental was not a living plant, fed by blood it had 
worked to produce, but a cannibal of the moment, devouring the unborn 
children of greatness. 

The tax on Colorado, she thought, the tax collected from Ellis Wyatt to 
pay for the livelihood of those whose job was to tie him and make him unable 
to live, those who would stand on guard to see that he got no trains, no tank 
cars, no pipeline of Rearden Metal— Ellis Wyatt, stripped of the right of 
serf-defense, left without voice, without weapons, and worse: made to be the 
tool of his own destruction, the supporter of his own destroyers, the 
provider of their food and of their weapons— Ellis Wyatt being choked, with 
his own bright energy turned against him as the noose— Ellis Wyatt, who had 
wanted to tap an unlimited source of shale oil and who spoke of a Second 
Renaissance. . . . 

She sat bent over, her head on her arms, slumped at the, ledge of the 
window— while the great curves of the green-blue rail, the mountains, the 
valleys, the new towns of Colorado went by in the darkness, unseen. 



The sudden jolt of brakes on wheels threw her upright. It was an 
unscheduled stop, and the platform of the small station was crowded with 
people, all looking off in the same direction. The passengers around her were 
pressing to the windows, staring. She leaped to her feet, she ran down the 
aisle, down the steps, into the cold wind sweeping the platform. 

In the instant before she saw it and her scream cut the voices of the 
crowd, she knew that she had known that which she was to see. In a break 
between mountains, lighting the sky, throwing a glow that swayed on the roofs 
and walls of the station, the hill of Wyatt Oil was a solid sheet of flame. 

Later, when they told her that Ellis Wyatt had vanished, leaving nothing 
behind but a board he had nailed to a post at the foot of the hill, when she 
looked at his handwriting on the board, she felt as if she had almost known 
that these would be the words: "I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. 
It's yours." 



PART II 
EITHER- OR 



CHAPTER I 
THE MAN WHO BELONGED ON EARTH 



Dr. Robert Stadler paced his office, wishing he would not feel the cold. 
Spring had been late in coming. Beyond the window, the dead gray of the hills 
looked like the smeared transition from the soiled white of the sky to the 
leaden black of the river. Once in a while, a distant patch of hillside 
flared into a silver-yellow that was almost green, then vanished. The clouds 
kept cracking for the width of a single sunray, then oozing closed again. It 
was not cold in the office, thought Dr. Stadler, it was that view that froze 
the place. 

It was not cold today, the chill was in his bones— he thought— the stored 
accumulation of the winter months, when he had had to be distracted from his 
work by an awareness of such a matter as inadequate heating and people had 
talked about conserving fuel. It was preposterous, he thought, this growing 
intrusion of the accidents of nature into the affairs of men: it had never 
mattered before, if a winter happened to be unusually severe; if a flood 
washed out a section of railroad track, one did not spend two weeks eating 
canned vegetables; if an electric storm struck some power station, an 
establishment such as the State Science Institute was not left without 
electricity for five days. Five days of stillness this winter, he thought, 
with the great laboratory motors stopped and irretrievable hours wiped out, 
when his staff had been working on problems that involved the heart of the 
universe. He turned angrily away from the window— but stopped and turned back 
to it again. He did not want to see the book that lay on his desk. 

He wished Dr. Ferris would come. He glanced at his watch: Dr. 

Ferris was late— an astonishing matter— late for an appointment with him— Dr. 
Floyd Ferris, the valet of science, who had always faced him in a manner that 
suggested an apology for having but one hat to take off. 

This was outrageous weather for the month of May, he thought, looking down 
at the river; it was certainly the weather that made him feel as he did, not 
the book. He had placed the book in plain view on his desk, when he had noted 
that his reluctance to see it was more than mere revulsion, that it contained 
the element of an emotion never to be admitted. He told himself that he had 
risen from his desk, not because the book lay there, but merely because he 
had wanted to move, feeling cold. He paced the room, trapped between the desk 
and the window. He would throw that book in the ash can where it belonged, he 
thought, just as soon as he had spoken to Dr. Ferris. 

He watched the patch of green and sunlight on the distant hill, the 
promise of spring in a world that looked as if no grass or bud would ever 
function again. He smiled eagerly— and when the patch vanished, he felt a stab 
of humiliation, at his own eagerness, at the desperate way he had wanted to 
hold it. It reminded him of that interview with the eminent novelist, last 
winter. The novelist had come from Europe to write an article about him— and 
he, who had once despised interviews, had talked eagerly, lengthily, too 
lengthily, seeing a promise of intelligence in the novelist's face, feeling a 
causeless, desperate need to be understood. The article had come out as a 
collection of sentences that gave him exorbitant praise and garbled every 
thought he had expressed. Closing the magazine, he had felt what he was 
feeling now at the desertion of a sunray. 

All right— he thought, turning away from the window— he would concede that 
attacks of loneliness had begun to strike him at times; but it was a 
loneliness to which he was entitled, it was hunger for the response of some 
living, thinking mind. He was so tired of all those people, he thought in 
contemptuous bitterness; he dealt with cosmic rays, while they were unable to 
deal with an electric storm. 



He felt the sudden contraction of his mouth, like a slap denying him the 
right to pursue this course of thought. He was looking at the book on his 
desk. Its glossy jacket was glaring and new; it had been published two weeks 
ago. But I had nothing to do with it!— he screamed to himself; the scream 
seemed wasted on a merciless silence; nothing answered it, no echo of 
forgiveness. The title on the book's jacket was Why Do You Think You Think? 

There was no sound in that courtroom silence within him, no pity, no voice 
of defense— nothing but the paragraphs which his great memory had reprinted on 
his brain: "Thought is a primitive superstition. Reason is an irrational 
idea . 

The childish notion that we are able to think has been mankind's costliest 
error . " 

"What you think you think is an illusion created by your glands, your 
emotions and, in the last analysis, by the content of your stomach." 

"That gray matter you're so proud of is like a mirror in an amusement park 
which transmits to you nothing but distorted signals from a reality forever 
beyond your grasp." 

"The more certain you feel of your rational conclusions, the more certain 
you are to be wrong. Your brain being an instrument of distortion, the more 
active the brain the greater the distortion." 

"The giants of the intellect, whom you admire so much, once taught you 
that the earth was flat and that the atom was the smallest particle of 
matter. The entire history of science is a progression of exploded fallacies, 
not of achievements." 

"The more we know, the more we learn that we know nothing." 

"Only the crassest ignoramus can still hold to the old-fashioned notion 
that seeing is believing. That which you see is the first thing to 
disbelieve . " 

"A scientist knows that a stone is not a stone at all. It is, in fact, 
identical with a feather pillow. Both are only a cloud formation of the same 
invisible, whirling particles. But, you say, you can't use a stone for a 
pillow? Well, that merely proves your helplessness in the face of actual 
reality . " 

"The latest scientific discoveries— such as the tremendous achievements of 
Dr. Robert Stadler— have demonstrated conclusively that our reason is 
incapable of dealing with the nature of the universe. These discoveries have 
led scientists to contradictions which are impossible, according to the human 
mind, but which exist in reality nonetheless. 

If you have not yet heard it, my dear old-fashioned friends, it has now 
been proved that the rational is the insane." 

"Do not expect consistency. Everything is a contradiction of everything 
else. Nothing exists but contradictions." 

"Do not look for 'common sense.' To demand 'sense' is the hallmark of 
nonsense. Nature does not make sense. Nothing makes sense. The only crusaders 
for 'sense' are the studious type of adolescent old maid who can't find a boy 
friend, and the old-fashioned shopkeeper who thinks that the universe is as 
simple as his neat little inventory and beloved cash register." 

"Let us break the chains of the prejudice called Logic. Are we going to be 
stopped by a syllogism?" 

"So you think you're sure of your opinions? You cannot be sure of 
anything. Are you going to endanger the harmony of your community, your 
fellowship with your neighbors, your standing, reputation, good name and 
financial security— for the sake of an illusion? For the sake of the mirage of 
thinking that you think? Are you going to run risks and court disasters— at a 
precarious time like ours— by opposing the existing social order in the name 
of those imaginary notions of yours which you call your convictions? You say 
that you're sure you're right? Nobody is right, or ever can be. You feel that 



the world around you is wrong? You have no means to know it. Everything is 
wrong in human eyes— so why fight it? Don't argue. Accept. Adjust yourself. 
Obey. " 

The book was written by Dr. Floyd Ferris and published by the State 
Science Institute. 

"I had nothing to do with it!" said Dr. Robert Stadler. He stood still by 
the side of his desk, with the uncomfortable feeling of having missed some 
beat of time, of not knowing how long the preceding moment had lasted. He had 
pronounced the words aloud, in a tone of rancorous sarcasm directed at 
whoever had made him say it. 

He shrugged. Resting on the belief that self-mockery is an act of virtue, 
the shrug was the emotional equivalent of the sentence: You're Robert 
Stadler, don't act like a high-school neurotic. He sat down at his desk and 
pushed the book aside with the back of his hand. 

Dr. Floyd Ferris arrived half an hour late. "Sorry," he said, "but my car 
broke down again on the way from Washington and I had a hell of a time trying 
to find somebody to fix it— there's getting to be so damn few cars out on the 
road that half the service stations are closed." 

There was more annoyance than apology in his voice. He sat down without 
waiting for an invitation to do so. 

- Dr. Floyd Ferris would not have been noticed as particularly handsome in 
any other profession, but in the one he had chosen he was always described as 
"that good-looking scientist." He was six feet tall and forty-five years old, 
but he managed to look taller and younger. 

He had an air of immaculate grooming and a ballroom grace of motion, but 
his clothes were severe, his suits being usually black or midnight blue. He 
had a finely traced mustache, and his smooth black hair made the Institute 
office boys say that he used the same shoe polish on both ends of him. He did 
not mind repeating, in the tone of a joke on himself, that a movie producer 
once said he would cast him for the part of a titled European gigolo. He had 
begun his career as a biologist, but that was forgotten long ago; he was 
famous as the Top Co-ordinator of the State Science Institute. 

Dr. Stadler glanced at him with astonishment— the lack of apology was 
unprecedented— and said dryly, "It seems to me that you are spending a great 
deal of your time in Washington." 

"But, Dr. Stadler, wasn't it you who once paid me the compliment of 
calling me the watchdog of this Institute?" said Dr. Ferris pleasantly. 

"Isn't that my most essential duty?" 

"A few of your duties seem to be accumulating right around this place. 
Before I forget it, would you mind telling me what's going on here about that 
oil shortage mess?" 

He could not understand why Dr. Ferris' face tightened into an injured 
look, "You will permit me to say that this is unexpected and unwarranted, " 
said Dr. Ferris in that tone of formality which conceals pain and reveals 
martyrdom. "None of the authorities involved have found cause for criticism. 
We have just submitted a detailed report on the progress of the work to date 
to the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources, and Mr. Wesley 
Mouch has expressed himself as satisfied. We have done our best on that 
project. We have heard no one else describe it as a mess. Considering the 
difficulties of the terrain, the hazards of the fire and the fact that it has 
been only six months since we—" 

"What are you talking about?" asked Dr. Stadler. 

'The Wyatt Reclamation Project. Isn't that what you asked me?" 

"No," said Dr. Stadler, "no, I . . . Wait a moment. Let me get this 
straight. I seem to recall something about this Institute taking charge of a 
reclamation project. What is it that you're reclaiming?" 

"Oil," said Dr. Ferris. "The Wyatt oil fields." 



"That was a fire, wasn't it? In Colorado? That was . . . wait a moment . . 
. that was the man who set fire to his own oil wells." 

"I'm inclined to believe that that's a rumor created by public hysteria," 
said Dr. Ferris dryly. '"A rumor with some undesirable, unpatriotic 
implications. I wouldn't put too much faith in those newspaper stories. 
Personally, I believe that it was an accident and that Ellis Wyatt perished 
in the fire." 

"Well, who owns those fields now?" 

"Nobody— at the moment. There being no will or heirs, the government has 
taken charge of operating the fields— as a measure of public necessity— for 
seven years. If Ellis Wyatt does not return within that time, he will be 
considered officially dead." 

"Well, why did they come to you— to us, for such an unlikely assignment as 
oil pumping?" 

"Because it is a problem of great technological difficulty, requiring the 
services of the best scientific talent available. You see, it is a matter of 
reconstructing the special method of oil extraction that Wyatt had employed. 
His equipment is still there, though in a dreadful condition; some of his 
processes are known, but somehow there is no full record of the complete 
operation or the basic principle involved. That is what we have to 
rediscover . " 

"And how is it going?" 

"The progress is most gratifying. We have just been granted a new and 
larger appropriation. Mr. Wesley Mouch is pleased with our work. 

So are Mr. Balch of the Emergency Commission, Mr. Anderson of Crucial 
Supplies and Mr. Pettibone of Consumers' Protection. I do not see what more 
could be expected of us. The project is fully successful." 

"Have you produced any oil?" 

"No, but we have succeeded in forcing a flow from one of the wells, to the 
extent of six and a half gallons. This, of course, is merely of experimental 
significance, but you must take into consideration the fact that we had to 
spend three full months just to put out the fire, which has now been totally— 
almost totally— extinguished . We have a much tougher problem than Wyatt ever 
had, because he started from scratch while we have to deal with the 
disfigured wreckage of an act of vicious, anti-social sabotage which ... I 
mean to say, it is a difficult problem, but there is no doubt that we will be 
able to solve it." 

"Well, what I really asked you about was the oil shortage here, in the 
Institute. The level of temperature maintained in this building all winter 
was outrageous. They told me that they had to conserve oil. 

Surely you could have seen to it that the matter of keeping this place 
adequately supplied with such things as oil was handled more efficiently." 

"Oh, is that what you had in mind, Dr. Stadler? Oh, but I am so sorry!" 
The words came with a bright smile of relief on Dr. Ferris' 

face; his solicitous manner returned. "Do you mean that the temperature 
was low enough to cause you discomfort?" 

"I mean that I nearly froze to death." 

"But that is unforgivable! Why didn't they tell me? Please accept my 
personal apology, Dr. Stadler, and rest assured that you will never be 
inconvenienced again. The only excuse I can offer for our maintenance 
department is that the shortage of fuel was not due to their negligence, it 
was— oh, I realize that you would not know about it and such matters should 
not take up your invaluable attention— but, you see, the oil shortage last 
winter was a nation-wide crisis." 

"Why? For heaven's sake, don't tell me that those Wyatt fields were the 
only source of oil in the country!" 



"No, no, but the sudden disappearance of a major supply wrought havoc in 
the entire oil market. So the government had to assume control and impose oil 
rationing on the country, in order to protect the essential enterprises. I 
did obtain an unusually large quota for the Institute— 

and only by the special favor of some very special connections— but I feel 
abjectly guilty if this proved insufficient. Rest assured that it will not 
happen again. It is only a temporary emergency. By next winter, we shall have 
the Wyatt fields back in production, and conditions will return to normal. 
Besides, as far as this Institute is concerned, I made all the arrangements 
to convert our furnaces to coal, and it was to be done next month, only the 
Stockton Foundry in Colorado closed down suddenly, without notice— they were 
casting parts for our furnaces, but Andrew Stockton retired, quite 
unexpectedly, and now we have to wait till his nephew reopens the plant." 

"I see. Well, I trust that you will take care of it among all your other 
activities." Dr. Stadler shrugged with annoyance. "It is becoming a little 
ridiculous— the number of technological ventures that an institution of 
science has to handle for the government." 

"But, Dr. Stadler-" 

"I know, I know, it can't be avoided. By the way, what is Project X?" 

Dr. Ferris' eyes shot to him swiftly— an odd, bright glance of alertness, 
that seemed startled, but not frightened. "Where did you hear about Project 
X, Dr. Stadler?" 

"Oh, I heard a couple of your younger boys saying something about it with 
an air of mystery you'd expect from amateur detectives. They told me it was 
something very secret." 

"That's right, Dr. Stadler. It is an extremely secret research project 
which the government has entrusted to us. And it is of utmost importance that 
the newspapers get no word about it." 

"What's the X?" 

"Xylophone. Project Xylophone. That is a code name, of course. 

The work has to do with sound. But I am sure that it would not interest 
you. It is a purely technological undertaking." 

"Yes, do spare me the story. I have no time for your technological 
undertakings . " 

"May I suggest that it would be advisable to refrain from mentioning the 
words 'Project X' to anyone, Dr. Stadler?" 

"Oh, all right, all right. I must say I do not enjoy discussions of that 
kind. " 

"But of course! And I wouldn't forgive myself if I allowed your time to be 
taken up by such concerns. Please feel certain that you may safely leave it 
to me." He made a movement to rise. "Now if this was the reason you wanted to 
see me, please believe that I—" 

"No," said Dr. Stadler slowly. "This was not the reason I wanted to see 
you . " 

Dr. Ferris volunteered no questions, no eager offers of service; he 
remained seated, merely waiting. 

Dr. Stadler reached over and made the book slide from the corner to the 
center of his desk, with a contemptuous flick of one hand. "Will you tell me, 
please," he asked, "what is this piece of indecency?" 

Dr. Ferris did not glance at the book, but kept his eyes fixed on 
Stadler 's for an inexplicable moment; then he leaned back and said with an 
odd smile, "I feel honored that you chose to make such an exception for my 
sake as reading a popular book. This little piece has sold twenty thousand 
copies in two weeks." 

"I have read it . " 

"And?" 

"I expect an explanation." 



"Did you find the text confusing?" 

Dr. Stadler looked at him in bewilderment. "Do you realize what theme you 
chose to treat and in what manner? The style alone, the style, the gutter 
kind of attitude— for a subject of this nature!" 

"Do you think, then, that the content deserved a more dignified form of 
presentation?" The voice was so innocently smooth that Dr. 

Stadler could not decide whether this was mockery. 

"Do you realize what you're preaching in this book?" 

"Since you do not seem to approve of it, Dr. Stadler, I'd rather have you 
think that I wrote it innocently." 

This was it, thought Dr. Stadler, this was the incomprehensible element in 
Ferris' manner: he had supposed that an indication of his disapproval would 
be sufficient, but Ferris seemed to remain untouched by it "If a drunken lout 
could find the power to express himself on paper, " 

said Dr. Stadler, "if he could give voice to his essence— the eternal 
savage, leering his hatred of the mind— this is the sort of book I would 
expect him to write. But to see it come from a scientist, under the imprint 
of this Institute!" 

"But, Dr. Stadler, this book was not intended to be read by scientists. It 
was written for that drunken lout." 

"What do you mean?" 

"For the general public." 

"But, good God! The feeblest imbecile should be able to see the glaring 
contradictions in every one of your statements." 

"Let us put it this way, Dr. Stadler: the man who doesn't see that, 
deserves to believe all my statements." 

"But you've given the prestige of science to that unspeakable stuff! 

It was all right for a disreputable mediocrity like Simon Pritchett to 
drool it as some sort of woozy mysticism— nobody listened to him. But you've 
made them think it's science. Science! You've taken the achievements of the 
mind to destroy the mind. By what right did you use my work to make an 
unwarranted, preposterous switch into another field, pull an inapplicable 
metaphor and draw a monstrous generalization out of what is merely a 
mathematical problem? By what right did you make it sound as if I— I.' — gave my 
sanction to that book?" 

Dr. Ferris did nothing, he merely looked at Dr. Stadler calmly; but the 
calm gave him an air that was almost patronizing. "Now, you see, Dr. Stadler, 
you're speaking as if this book were addressed to a thinking audience. If it 
were, one would have to be concerned with such matters as accuracy, validity, 
logic and the prestige of science. But it isn't. It's addressed to the 
public. And you have always been first to believe that the public does not 
think." He paused, but Dr, Stadler said nothing. 

"This book may have no philosophical value whatever, but it has a great 
psychological value." 

"Just what is that?" 

"You see, Dr. Stadler, people don't want to think. And the deeper they get 
into trouble, the less they want to think. But by some sort of instinct, they 
feel that they ought to and it makes them feel guilty. So they'll bless and 
follow anyone who gives them a justification for not thinking. Anyone who 
makes a virtue— a highly intellectual virtue- 
out of what they know to be their sin, their weakness and their guilt." 
"And you propose to pander to that?" 
"That is the road to popularity." 
"Why should you seek popularity?" 

Dr. Ferris' eyes moved casually to Dr. Stadler 's face, as if by pure 
accident. "We are a public institution," he answered evenly, "supported by 
public funds." 



"So you tell people that science is a futile fraud which ought to be 
abolished ! " 

"That is a conclusion which could be drawn, in logic, from my book. 
But that is not the conclusion they will draw." 

"And what about the disgrace to the Institute in the eyes of the men of 
intelligence, wherever such may be left?" 
"Why should we worry about them?" 

Dr. Stadler could have regarded the sentence as conceivable, had it been 
uttered with hatred, envy or malice; but the absence of any such emotion, the 
casual ease of the voice, an ease suggesting a chuckle, hit him like a 
moment's glimpse of a realm that could not be taken as part of reality; the 
thing spreading down to his stomach was cold terror. 

"Did you observe the reactions to my book, Dr. Stadler? It was received 
with considerable favor." 

"Yes— and that is what I find impossible to believe." He had to speak, he 
had to speak as if this were a civilized discussion, he could not allow 
himself time to know what it was he had felt for a moment. 

"I am unable to understand the attention you received in all the reputable 
academic magazines and how they could permit themselves to discuss your book 
seriously. If Hugh Akston were around, no academic publication would have 
dared to treat this as a work admissible into the realm of philosophy." 

"He is not around." 

Dr. Stadler felt that there were words which he was now called upon to 
pronounce— and he wished he could end this conversation before he discovered 
what they were. 

"On the other hand," said Dr, Ferris, "the ads for my book— oh, I'm sure 
you wouldn't notice such things as ads— quote a letter of high praise which I 
received from Mr. Wesley Mouch." 

"Who the hell is Mr. Wesley Mouch?" 

Dr. Ferris smiled. "In another year, even you won't ask that question, Dr. 
Stadler. Let us put it this way: Mr. Mouch is the man who is rationing oil— 
for the time being." 

"Then I suggest that you stick to your job. Deal with Mr. Mouch and leave 
him the realm of oil furnaces, but leave the realm of ideas to me." 

"It would be curious to try to formulate the line of demarcation, " 

said Dr. Ferris, in the tone of an idle academic remark. "But if we're 
talking about my book, why, then we're talking about the realm of public 
relations." He turned to point solicitously at the mathematical formulas 
chalked on the blackboard. "Dr. Stadler, it would be disastrous if you 
allowed the realm of public relations to distract you from the work which you 
alone on earth are capable of doing." 

It was said with obsequious deference, and Dr. Stadler could not tell what 
made him hear in it the sentence: "Stick to your blackboard!" 

He felt a biting irritation and he switched it against himself, thinking 
angrily that he had to get rid of these suspicions. 

"Public relations?" he said contemptuously. "I don't see any practical 
purpose in your book. I don't see what it's intended to accomplish." 

"Don't you?" Dr. Ferrisl eyes flickered briefly to his face; the sparkle 
of insolence was too swift to be identified with certainty. 

"I cannot permit myself to consider certain things as possible in a 
civilized society," Dr. Stadler said sternly. 

"That is admirably exact," said Dr. Ferris cheerfully. "You cannot permit 
yourself . " 

Dr. Ferris rose, being first to indicate that the interview was ended. 

"Please call for me whenever anything occurs in this Institute to cause 
you discomfort, Dr. Stadler," he said. "It is my privilege always to be at 
your service . " 



Knowing that he had to assert his authority, smothering the shameful 
realization of the sort of substitute he was choosing, Dr. Stadler said 
imperiously, in a tone of sarcastic rudeness, "The next time I call for you, 
you'd better do something about that car of yours." 

"Yes, Dr. Stadler. I shall make certain never to be late again, and I beg 
you to forgive me." Dr. Ferris responded as if playing a part on cue; as if 
he were pleased that Dr. Stadler had learned, at last, the modern method of 
communication. "My car has been causing me a great deal of trouble, it's 
falling to pieces, and I had ordered a new one sometime ago, the best one on 
the market, a Hammond convertible— 

but Lawrence Hammond went out of business last week, without reason or 
warning, so now I'm stuck. Those bastards seem to be vanishing somewhere. 
Something will have to be done about it." 

When Ferris had gone, Dr. Stadler sat at his desk, his shoulders shrinking 
together, conscious only of a desperate wish not to be seen by anyone. In the 
fog of the pain which he would not define, there was also the desperate 
feeling that no one— no one of those he valued— 

would ever wish to see him again. 

He knew the words which he had not uttered. He had not said that he would 
denounce the book in public and repudiate it in the name of the Institute. He 
had not said it, because he had been afraid to discover that the threat would 
leave Ferris unmoved, that Ferris was safe, that the word of Dr. Robert 
Stadler had no power any longer. And while he told himself that he would 
consider later the question of making a public protest, he knew that he would 
not make it. 

He picked up the book and let it drop into the wastebasket. 

A face came to his mind, suddenly and clearly, as if he were seeing the 
purity of its every line, a young face he had not permitted himself to recall 
for years. He thought: No, he has not read this book, he won't see it, he's 
dead, he must have died long ago. . . . The sharp pain was the shock of 
discovering simultaneously that this was the man he longed to see more than 
any other being in the world— and that he had to hope that this man was dead. 

He did not know why— when the telephone rang and his secretary told him 
that Miss Dagny Taggart was on the line— why he seized the receiver with 
eagerness and noticed that his hand was trembling. She would never want to 
see him again, he had thought for over a year. He heard her clear, impersonal 
voice asking for an appointment to see him. 

"Yes, Miss Taggart, certainly, yes, indeed. . . . Monday morning? 

Yes— look, Miss Taggart, I have an engagement in New York today, I could 
drop in at your office this afternoon, if you wish. . . . No, no —no trouble 
at all, I'll be delighted. . . . This afternoon, Miss Taggart, about two— I 
mean, about four o'clock." 

He had no engagement in New York. He did not give himself time to know 
what had prompted him to do it. He was smiling eagerly, looking at a patch of 
sunlight on a distant hill. 

Dagny drew a black line across Train Number 93 on the schedule, and felt a 
moment's desolate satisfaction in noting that she did it calmly. It was an 
action which she had had to perform many times in the last six months. It had 
been hard, at first; it was becoming easier. 

The day would come, she thought, when she would be able to deliver that 
death stroke even without the small salute of an effort. Train Number 93 was 
a freight that had earned its living by carrying supplies to Hammondsville, 
Colorado . 

She knew what steps would come next: first, the death of the special 
freights— then the shrinking in the number of boxcars for Hammondsville, 
attached, like poor relatives, to the rear end of freights bound for other 
towns— then the gradual cutting of the stops at Hammondsville Station from the 



schedules of the passenger trains— then the day when she would strike 
Hammondsville, Colorado, off the map. That had been the progression of Wyatt 
Junction and of the town called Stockton. 

She knew— once word was received that Lawrence Hammond had retired— that it 
was useless to wait, to hope and to wonder whether his cousin, his lawyer or 
a committee of local citizens would reopen the plant. She knew it was time to 
start cutting the schedules. 

It had lasted less than six months after Ellis Wyatt had gone— that period 
which a columnist had gleefully called "the field day of the little fellow." 
Every oil operator in the country, who owned three wells and whined that 
Ellis Wyatt left him no chance of livelihood, had rushed to fill the hole 
which Wyatt had left wide open. They formed leagues, cooperatives, 
associations; they pooled their resources and their letter heads, "The little 
fellow's day in the sun," the columnist had said. Their sun had been the 
flames that twisted through the derricks of Wyatt Oil. In its glare, they 
made the kind of fortunes they had dreamed about, fortunes requiring no 
competence or effort. Then their biggest customers, such as power companies, 
who drank oil by the trainful and would make no allowances for human frailty, 
began to convert to coal —and the smaller customers, who were more tolerant, 
began to go out of business— the boys in Washington imposed rationing on oil 
and an emergency tax on employers to support the unemployed oil field 
workers— then a few of the big oil companies closed down— then the little 
fellows in the sun discovered that a drilling bit which had cost a hundred 
dollars, now cost them five hundred, there being no market for oil field 
equipment, and the suppliers having to earn on one drill what they had earned 
on five, or perish— then the pipe lines began to close, there being no one 
able to pay for their upkeep— then the railroads were granted permission to 
raise their freight rates, there being little oil to carry and the cost of 
running tank trains having crushed two small lines out of existence— and when 
the sun went down, they saw that the operating costs, which had once 
permitted them to exist on their sixty-acre fields, had been made possible by 
the miles of Wyatt ' s hillside and had gone in the same coils of smoke. Not 
until their fortunes had vanished and their pumps had stopped, did the little 
fellows realize that no business in the country could afford to buy oil at 
the price it would now take them to produce it. Then the boys in Washington 
granted subsidies to the oil operators, but not all of the oil operators had 
friends in Washington, and there followed a situation which no one cared to 
examine too closely or to discuss. 

Andrew Stockton had been in the sort of position which most of the 
businessmen envied. The rush to convert to coal had descended upon his 
shoulders like a weight of gold: he had kept his plant working around the 
clock, running a race with next winter's blizzards, casting parts for coal- 
burning stoves and furnaces. There were not many dependable foundries left; 
he had become one of the main pillars supporting the cellars and kitchens of 
the country. The pillar collapsed without warning. Andrew Stockton announced 
that lie was retiring, closed his plant and vanished. He left no word on what 
he wished to be done with the plant or whether his relatives had the right to 
reopen it. 

There still were cars on the roads of the country, but they moved like 
travelers in the desert, who ride past the warning skeletons of horses 
bleached by the sun: they moved past the skeletons of cars that had collapsed 
on duty and had been left in the ditches by the side of the road. People were 
not buying cars any longer, and the automobile factories were closing. But 
there were men still able to get oil, by means of friendships that nobody 
cared to question. These men bought cars at any price demanded. Lights 
flooded the mountains of Colorado from the great windows of the plant, where 
the assembly belts of Lawrence Hammond poured trucks and cars to the sidings 



of Taggart Transcontinental. The word that Lawrence Hammond had retired came 
when least expected, brief and sudden like the single stroke of a bell in a 
heavy stillness. A committee of local citizens was now broadcasting appeals 
on the radio, begging Lawrence Hammond, wherever he was, to give them 
permission to reopen his plant. There was no answer. 

She had screamed when Ellis Wyatt went; she had gasped when Andrew 
Stockton retired; when she heard that Lawrence Hammond had quit, she asked 
impassively, "Who's next?" 

"No, Miss Taggart, I can't explain it," the sister of Andrew Stockton had 
told her on her last trip to Colorado, two months ago. "He never said a word 
to me and I don't even know whether he's dead or living, same as Ellis Wyatt. 
No, nothing special had happened the day before he quit. I remember only that 
some man came to see him on that last evening. A stranger I'd never seen 
before. They talked late into the night— when I went to sleep, the light was 
still burning in Andrew's study." 

People were silent in the towns of Colorado. Dagny had seen the way they 
walked in the streets, past their small drugstores, hardware stores and 
grocery markets: as if they hoped that the motions of their jobs would save 
them from looking ahead at the future. She, too, had walked through those 
streets, trying not to lift her head, not to see the ledges of sooted rock 
and twisted steel, which had been the Wyatt oil fields. They could be seen 
from many of the towns; when she had looked ahead, she had seen them in the 
distance . 

One well, on the crest of the hill, was still burning. Nobody had been 
able to extinguish it. She had seen it from the streets: a spurt of fire 
twisting convulsively against the sky, as if trying to tear loose. She had 
seen it at night, across the distance of a hundred clear, black miles, from 
the window of a train: a small, violent flame, waving in the wind. 

People called it Wyatt ' s Torch. 

The longest train on the John Gait Line had forty cars; the fastest ran at 
fifty miles an hour. The engines had to be spared: they were coal burning 
engines, long past their age of retirement. Jim obtained the oil for the 
Diesels that pulled the Comet and a few of their transcontinental freights. 
The only source of fuel she could count on and deal with was Ken Danagger of 
Danagger Coal in Pennsylvania. 

Empty trains clattered through the four states that were tied, as 
neighbors, to the throat of Colorado. They carried a few carloads of sheep, 
some corn, some melons and an occasional farmer with an overdressed family, 
who had friends in Washington. Jim had obtained a subsidy from Washington for 
every train that was run, not as a profit making carrier, but as a service of 
"public equality." 

It took every scrap of her energy to keep trains running through the 
sections where they were still needed, in the areas that were still 
producing. But on the balance sheets of Taggart Transcontinental, the checks 
of Jim's subsidies for empty trains bore larger figures than the profit 
brought by the best freight train of the busiest industrial division. 

Jim boasted that this had been the most prosperous six months in Taggart 
history. Listed as profit, on the glossy pages of his report to the 
stockholders, was the money he had not earned— the subsidies for empty trains; 
and the money he did not own— the sums that should have gone to pay the 
interest and the retirement of Taggart bonds, the debt which, by the will of 
Wesley Mouch, he had been permitted not to pay. He boasted about the greater 
volume of freight carried by Taggart trains in Arizona— where Dan Conway had 
closed the last of the Phoenix-Durango and retired; and in Minnesota— where 
Paul Larkin was shipping iron ore by rail, and the last of the ore boats on 
the Great Lakes had gone out of existence. 



"You have always considered money-making as such an important virtue, " Jim 
had said to her with an odd half-smile. "Well, it seems to me that I'm better 
at it than you are." 

Nobody professed to understand the question of the frozen railroad bonds; 
perhaps, because everybody understood it too well. At first, there had been 
signs of a panic among the bondholders and of a dangerous indignation among 
the public. Then, Wesley Mouch had issued another directive, which ruled that 
people could get their bonds "defrozen" upon a plea of "essential need": the 
government would purchase the bonds, if it found the proof of the need 
satisfactory. There were three questions that no one answered or asked: "What 
constituted proof?" "What constituted need?" "Essential— to whom?" 

Then it became bad manners to discuss why one man received the grant 
defreezing his money, while another had been refused. People turned away in 
mouth-pinched silence, if anybody asked a "why?" One was supposed to 
describe, not to explain, to catalogue facts, not to evaluate them: Mr. Smith 
had been defrozen, Mr. Jones had not; that was all. And when Mr. Jones 
committed suicide, people said, "Well, I don't know, if he'd really needed 
his money, the government would have given it to him, but some men arc just 
greedy. " 

One was not supposed to speak about the men who, having been refused, sold 
their bonds for one-third of the value to other men who possessed needs 
which, miraculously, made thirty-three frozen cents melt into a whole dollar; 
or about a new profession practiced by bright young boys just out of college, 
who called themselves "defreezers" and offered their services "to help you 
draft your application in the proper modern terms." The boys had friends in 
Washington, Looking at the Taggart rail from the platform of some country 
station, she had found herself feeling, not the brilliant pride she had once 
felt, but a foggy, guilty shame, as if some foul kind of rust had grown on 
the metal, and worse: as if the rust had a tinge of blood. But then, in the 
concourse of the Terminal, she looked at the statue of Nat Taggart and 
thought: It was your rail, you made it, you fought for it, you were not 
stopped by fear or by loathing— I won't surrender it to the men of blood and 
rust— and I'm the only one left to guard it. 

She had not given up her quest for the man who invented the motor. 

It was the only part of her work that made her able to bear the rest. 

It was the only goal in sight that gave meaning to her struggle. There 
were times when she wondered why she wanted to rebuild that motor. 

What for?— some voice seemed to ask her. Because I'm still alive, she 
answered. But her quest had remained futile. Her two engineers had found 
nothing in Wisconsin. She had sent them to search through the country for men 
who had worked for Twentieth Century, to learn the name of the inventor. They 
had learned nothing. She had sent them to search through the files of the 
Patent Office; no patent for the motor had ever been registered. 

The only remnant of her personal quest was the stub of the cigarette with 
the dollar sign. She had forgotten it, until a recent evening, when she had 
found it in a drawer of her desk and given it to her friend at the cigar 
counter of the concourse. The old man had been very astonished, as he 
examined the stub, holding it cautiously between two fingers; he had never 
heard of such a brand and wondered how he could have missed it. "Was it of 
good quality, Miss Taggart?" "The best I've ever smoked." He had shaken his 
head, puzzled. He had promised to discover where those cigarettes were made 
and to get her a carton. 

She had tried to find a scientist able to attempt the reconstruction of 
the motor. She had interviewed the men recommended to her as the best in 
their field. The first one, after studying the remnants of the motor and of 
the manuscript, had declared, in the tone of a drill sergeant, that the thing 
could not work, had never worked and he would prove that no. 



such motor could ever be made to work. The second one had drawled,, in the 
tone of an answer to a boring imposition, that he did not know whether it 
could be done or not and did not care to find out. The third had said, his 
voice belligerently insolent, that he would attempt the task on a ten-year 
contract at twenty-five thousand dollars a year— "After all, Miss Taggart, if 
you expect to make huge profits on that motor, it's you who should pay for 
the gamble of my time." The fourth, who was the youngest, had looked at her 
silently for a moment and the lines of his face had slithered from blankness 
into a suggestion of contempt. 

"You know, Miss Taggart, I don't think that such a motor should ever be 
made, even if somebody did learn how to make it. It would be so superior to 
anything we've got that it would be unfair to lesser scientists, because it 
would leave no field for their achievements and abilities. I don't think that 
the strong should have the right to wound the self esteem of the weak." She 
had ordered him out of her office, and had sat in incredulous horror before 
the fact that the most vicious statement she had ever heard had been uttered 
in a tone of moral righteousness. 

The decision to speak to Dr. Robert Stadler had been her last recourse. 

She had forced herself to call him, against the resistance of some 
immovable point within her that felt like brakes slammed tight. She had 
argued against herself. She had thought: I deal with men like Jim and Orren 
Boyle— his guilt is less than theirs— why can't I speak to him? 

She had found no answer, only a stubborn sense of reluctance, only the 
feeling that of all the men on earth, Dr. Robert Stadler was the one she must 
not call. 

As she sat at her desk, over the schedules of the John Gait Line, waiting 
for Dr. Stadler to come, she wondered why no first-rate talent had risen in 
the field of science for years. She was unable to look for an answer. She was 
looking at the black line which was the corpse of Train Number 93 on the 
schedule before her. 

A train has the two great attributes of life, she thought, motion and 
purpose; this had been like a living entity, but now it was only a number of 
dead freight cars and engines. Don't give yourself time to fee], she thought, 
dismember the carcass as fast as possible, the engines are needed all over 
the system, Ken Danagger in Pennsylvania needs trains, more trains, if only— 

"Dr. Robert Stadler," said the voice of the interoffice communicator on 
her desk. 

He came in, smiling; the smile seemed to underscore his words: "Miss 
Taggart, would you care to believe how helplessly glad I am to see you 
again?" 

She did not smile, she looked gravely courteous as she answered, "It was 
very kind of you to come here." She bowed, her slender figure standing tautly 
straight but for the slow, formal movement of her head. 

"What if I confessed that all I needed was some plausible excuse in order 
to come? Would it astonish you?" 

"I would try not to overtax your courtesy." She did not smile. "Please sit 
down, Dr. Stadler," 

He looked brightly around him. "I've never seen the office of a railroad 
executive. I didn't know it would be so . . .so solemn a place. Is that in 
the nature of the job?" 

"The matter on which I'd like to ask your advice is far removed from the 
field of your interests, Dr. Stadler. You may think it odd that I should call 
on you. Please allow me to explain my reason." 

"The fact that you wished to call on me is a fully sufficient reason. If I 
can be of any service to you, any service whatever, I don't know what would 
please me more at this moment." His smile had an attractive quality, the 



smile of a man of the world who used it, not to cover his words, but to 
stress the audacity of expressing a sincere emotion. 

"My problem is a matter of technology, " she said, in the clear, 
expressionless tone of a young mechanic discussing a difficult assignment. 

"I fully realize your contempt for that branch of science. I do not expect 
you to solve my problem— it is not the kind of work which you do or care 
about. I should like only to submit the problem to you, and then I'll have 
just two questions to ask you. I had to call on you, because it is a matter 
that involves someone's mind, a very great mind, and"— she spoke impersonally, 
in the manner of rendering exact justice— "and you are the only great mind 
left in this field." 

She could not tell why her words bit him as they did. She saw the 
stillness of his face, the sudden earnestness of the eyes, a strange 
earnestness that seemed eager and almost pleading, then she heard his voice 
come gravely, as if from under the pressure of some emotion that made it 
sound simple and humble: "What is your problem, Miss Taggart?" 

She told him about the motor and the place where she had found it; she 
told him that it had proved impossible to learn the name of the inventor; she 
did not mention the details of her quest. She handed him photographs of the 
motor and the remnant of the manuscript. 

She watched him as he read. She saw the professional assurance in the 
swift, scanning motion of his eyes, at first, then the pause, then the 
growing intentness, then a movement of his lips which, from another man, 
would have been a whistle or a gasp. She saw him stop for long minutes and 
look off, as if his mind were racing over countless sudden trails, trying to 
follow them all— she saw him leaf back through the pages, then stop, then 
force himself to read on, as if he were torn between his eagerness to 
continue and his eagerness to seize all the possibilities breaking open 
before his vision. She saw his silent excitement, she knew that he had 
forgotten her office, her existence, everything but the sight of an 
achievement— and in tribute to his being capable of such reaction, she wished 
it were possible for her to like Dr. Robert Stadler. 

They had been silent for over an hour, when he finished and looked up at 
her. "But this is extraordinary!" he said in the joyous, astonished tone of 
announcing some news she had not expected. 

She wished she could smile in answer and grant him the comradeship of a 
joy celebrated together, but she merely nodded and said coldly, "Yes." 

"But, Miss Taggart, this is tremendous!" 

"Yes . " 

"Did you say it's a matter of technology? It's more, much, much more than 
that. The pages where he writes about his converter— you can see what premise 
he's speaking from. He arrived at some new concept of energy. He discarded 
all our standard assumptions, according to which his motor would have been 
impossible. He formulated a new premise of his own and he solved the secret 
of converting static energy into kinetic power. Do you know what that means? 
Do you realize what a feat of pure, abstract science he had to perform before 
he could make his motor?" 

"Who?" she asked quietly. 

"I beg your pardon?" 

"That was the first of the two questions I wanted to ask you, Dr. 

Stadler: can you think of any young scientist you might have known ten 
years ago, who would have been able to do this?" 

He paused, astonished; he had not had time to wonder about that question. 
"No," he said slowly, frowning, "no, I can't think of anyone. 

. . . And that's odd . . . because an ability of this kind couldn't have 
passed unnoticed anywhere . . . somebody would have called him to my 
attention . . . they always sent promising young physicists to me. 



. . . Did you say you found this in the research laboratory of a plain, 
commercial motor factory?" 
"Yes . " 

"That's odd. What was he doing in such a place?" 
"Designing a motor." 

"That's what I mean. A man with the genius of a great scientist, who chose 
to be a commercial inventor? I find it outrageous. He wanted a motor, and he 
quietly performed a major revolution in the science of energy, just as a 
means to an end, and he didn't bother to publish his findings, but went right 
on making his motor. Why did he want to waste his mind on practical 
appliances?" 

"Perhaps because he liked living on this earth," she said involuntarily. 
"I beg your pardon?" 

"No, I . . .I'm sorry, Dr. Stadler. I did not intend to discuss any . . . 
irrelevant subject." 

He was looking off, pursuing his own course of thought, "Why didn't he 
come to me? Why wasn't he in some great scientific establishment where he 
belonged? If he had the brains to achieve this, surely he had the brains to 
know the importance of what he had done. Why didn't he publish a paper on his 
definition of energy? I can see the general direction he'd taken, but God 
damn him!— the most important pages are missing, the statement isn't here! 
Surely somebody around him should have known enough to announce his work to 
the whole world of science. Why didn't they? How could they abandon, just 
abandon, a thing of this kind?" 

"These are the questions to which I found no answers." 

"And besides, from the purely practical aspect, why was that motor left in 
a junk pile? You'd think any greedy fool of an industrialist would have 
grabbed it in order to make a fortune. No intelligence was needed to see its 
commercial value." 

She smiled for the first time— a smile ugly with bitterness; she said 
nothing . 

"You found it impossible to trace the inventor?" he asked. 

"Completely impossible— so far." 

"Do you think that he is still alive?" 

"I have reason to think that he is. But I can't be sure." 
"Suppose I tried to advertise for him?" 
"No. Don't." 

"But if I were to place ads in scientific publications and have Dr. 

Ferris"— he stopped; he saw her glance at him as swiftly as he glanced at 
her; she said nothing, but she held his glance; he looked away and finished 
the sentence coldly and firmly— "and have Dr. Ferris broadcast on the radio 
that I wish to see him, would he refuse to come?" 

"Yes, Dr. Stadler, I think he would refuse." 

He was not looking at her. She saw the faint tightening of his facial 
muscles and, simultaneously, the look of something going slack in the lines 
of his face; she could not tell what sort of light was dying within him nor 
what made her think of the death of a light. 

He tossed the manuscript down on the desk with a casual, contemptuous 
movement of his wrist. 'Those men who do not mind being practical enough to 
sell their brains for money, ought to acquire a little knowledge of the 
conditions of practical reality." 

He looked at her with a touch of defiance, as if waiting for an angry 
answer. But her answer was worse than anger: her face remained 
expressionless, as if the truth or falsehood of his convictions were of no 
concern to her any longer. She said politely, "The second question I wanted 
to ask you was whether you would be kind enough to tell me the name of any 



physicist you know who, in your judgment, would possess the ability to 
attempt the reconstruction of this motor." 

He looked at her and chuckled; it was a sound of pain. "Have you been 
tortured by it, too, Miss Taggart? By the impossibility of finding any sort 
of intelligence anywhere?" 

"I have interviewed some physicists who were highly recommended to me and 
I have found them to be hopeless." 

He leaned forward eagerly. "Miss Taggart," he asked, "did you call on me 
because you trusted the integrity of my scientific judgment?" 

The question was a naked plea. 

"Yes," she answered evenly, "I trusted the integrity of your scientific 
judgment . " 

He leaned back; he looked as if some hidden smile were smoothing the 
tension away from his face. "I wish I could help you," he said, as to a 
comrade. "I most selfishly wish I could help you, because, you see, this has 
been my hardest problem— trying to find men of talent for my own staff. 
Talent, hell! I'd be satisfied with just a semblance of promise —but the men 
they send me couldn't be honestly said to possess the potentiality of 
developing into decent garage mechanics. I don't know whether I am getting 
older and more demanding, or whether the human race is degenerating, but the 
world didn't seem to be so barren of intelligence in my youth. Today, if you 
saw the kind of men I've had to interview, you'd—" 

He stopped abruptly, as if at a sudden recollection. He remained silent; 
he seemed to be considering something he knew, but did not wish to tell her; 
she became certain of it, when he concluded brusquely, in that tone of 
resentment which conceals an evasion, "No, I don't know anyone I'd care to 
recommend to you." 

"This was all I wanted to ask you, Dr. Stadler, " she said. "Thank you for 
giving me your time." 

He sat silently still for a moment, as if he could not bring himself to 
leave . 

"Miss Taggart," he asked, "could you show me the actual motor itself?" 

She looked at him, astonished. "Why, yes ... if you wish. But it's in an 
underground vault, down in our Terminal tunnels." 

"I don't mind, if you wouldn't mind taking me down there. I have no 
special motive. It's only my personal curiosity. I would like to see it— 

that's all." 

When they stood in the granite vault, over a glass case containing a shape 
of broken metal, he took off his hat with a slow, absent movement— and she 
could not tell whether it was the routine gesture of remembering that he was 
in a room with a lady, or the gesture of baring one's head over a coffin. 

They stood in silence, in the glare of a single light refracted from the 
glass surface to their faces. Train wheels were clicking in the distance, and 
it seemed at times as if a sudden, sharper jolt of vibration were about to 
awaken an answer from the corpse in the glass case. 

"It's so wonderful," said Dr. Stadler, his voice low. "It's so wonderful 
to see a great, new, crucial idea which is not mine!" 

She looked at him, wishing she could believe that she understood him 
correctly. He spoke, in passionate sincerity, discarding convention, 
discarding concern for whether it was proper to let her hear the confession 
of his pain, seeing nothing but the face of a woman who was able to 
understand: "Miss Taggart, do you know the hallmark of the second-rater? It's 
resentment of another man's achievement. Those touchy mediocrities who sit 
trembling lest someone's work prove greater than their own— they have no 
inkling of the loneliness that comes when you reach the top. The loneliness 
for an equal— for a mind to respect and an achievement to admire. They bare 
their teeth at you from out of their rat holes, thinking that you take 



pleasure in letting your brilliance dim them— while you'd give a year of your 
life to see a flicker of talent anywhere among them. They envy achievement, 
and their dream of greatness is a world where all men have become their 
acknowledged inferiors. They don't know that that dream is the infallible 
proof of mediocrity., because that sort of world is what the man of 
achievement would not be able to bear. They have no way of knowing what he 
feels when surrounded by inferiors— hatred? no, not hatred, but boredom the 
terrible, hopeless, draining, paralyzing boredom. Of what account are praise 
and adulation from men whom you don't respect? Have you ever felt the longing 
for someone you could admire? For something, not to look down at, but up to?" 

"I've felt it all my life," she said. It was an answer she could not 
refuse him. 

"I know," he said— and there was beauty in the impersonal gentleness of his 
voice. "I knew it the first time I spoke to you. That was why I came today—" 
He stopped for the briefest instant, but she did not answer the appeal and he 
finished with the same quiet gentleness, "Well, that was why I wanted to see 
the motor." 

"I understand, " she said softly; the tone of her voice was the only form 
of acknowledgment she could grant him. 

"Miss Taggart, " he said, his eyes lowered, looking at the glass case, "I 
know a man who might be able to undertake the reconstruction of that motor. 
He would not work for me— so he is probably the kind of man you want." 

But by the time he raised his head— and before he saw the look of 
admiration in her eyes, the open look he had begged for, the look of 
forgiveness— he destroyed his single moment's atonement by adding in a voice 
of drawing-room sarcasm, "Apparently, the young man had no desire to work for 
the good of society or the welfare of science. He told me that he would not 
take a government job. I presume he wanted the bigger salary he could hope to 
obtain from a private employer." 

He turned away, not to see the look that was fading from her face, not to 
let himself know its meaning. "Yes," she said, her voice hard, "he is 
probably the kind of man I want." 

"He's a young physicist from the Utah Institute of Technology," 

he said dryly. "His name is Quentin Daniels. A friend of mine sent him to 
me a few months ago. He came to see me, but he would not take the job I 
offered. I wanted him on my staff. He had the mind of a scientist. I don't 
know whether he can succeed with your motor, but at least he has the ability 
to attempt it. I believe you can still reach him at the Utah Institute of 
Technology. I don't know what he's doing there now— they closed the Institute 
a year ago." 

"Thank you, Dr. Stadler. I shall get in touch with him." 

"If ... if you want me to, I'll be glad to help him with the theoretical 
part of it. I'm going to do some work myself, starting from the leads of that 
manuscript. I'd like to find the cardinal secret of energy that its author 
had found. It's his basic principle that we must discover. If we succeed, Mr. 
Daniels may finish the job, as far as your motor is concerned." 

"I will appreciate any help you may care to give me, Dr. Stadler." 

They walked silently -through the dead tunnels of the Terminal, down the 
ties of a rusted track under a string of blue lights, to the distant glow of 
the platforms. 

At the mouth of the tunnel, they saw a man kneeling on the track, 
hammering at a switch with the unrhythmical exasperation of uncertainty. 
Another man stood watching him impatiently. 

"Well, what's the matter with the damn thing?" asked the watcher. 

"Don't know." 

"You've been at it for an hour." 
"Yeah. " 



"How long is it going to take?" 
"Who is John Gait?" 

Dr. Stadler winced. They had gone past the men, when he said, "I don't 
like that expression." 

"I don't, either," she answered. 
"Where did it come from?" 
"Nobody knows . " 

They were silent, then he said, "I knew a John Gait once. Only he died 
long ago." 

"Who was he?" 

"I used to think that he was still alive. But now I'm certain that he must 
have died. He had such a mind that, had he lived, the whole world would have 
been talking of him by now." 

"But the whole world is talking of him." 

He stopped still. "Yes . . ."he said slowly, staring at a thought that 
had never struck him before, "yes . . . Why?" The word was heavy with the 
sound of terror. 

"Who was he, Dr. Stadler?" 

"Why are they talking of him?" 

"Who was he?" 

He shook his head with a shudder and said sharply, "It's just a 
coincidence. The name is not uncommon at all. It's a meaningless coincidence. 
It has no connection with the man I knew. That man is dead." 

He did not permit himself to know the full meaning of the words he added: 
"He has to be dead. "

The order that lay on his desk was marked "Confidential . . . 

Emergency . . . Priority . . . Essential need certified by office of Top 
Co-ordinator . . . for the account of Project X"— and demanded that he sell 
ten thousand tons of Rearden Metal to the State Science Institute. 

Rearden read it and glanced up at the superintendent of his mills who 
stood before him without moving. The superintendent had come in and put the 
order down on his desk without a word. 

"I thought you'd want to see it," he said, in answer to Rearden 's glance. 

Rearden pressed a button, summoning Miss Ives. He handed the order to her 
and said, "Send this back to wherever it came from. Tell them that I will not 
sell any Rearden Metal to the State Science Institute." 

Gwen Ives and the superintendent looked at him, at each other and back at 
him again; what he saw in their eyes was congratulation. 

"Yes, Mr. Rearden," Gwen Ives said formally, taking the slip as if it were 
any other kind of business paper. She bowed and left the room. The 
superintendent followed. 

Rearden smiled faintly, in greeting to what they felt. He felt nothing 
about that paper or its possible consequences. 

By a sort of inner convulsion— which had been like tearing a plug out to 
cut off the current of his emotions— he had told himself six months ago: Act 
first, keep the mills going, feel later. It had made him able to watch 
dispassionately the working of the Fair Share Law. 

Nobody had known how that law was to be observed. First, he had been told 
that he could not produce Rearden Metal in an amount greater than the tonnage 
of the best special alloy, other than steel, produced by Orren Boyle. But 
Orren Boyle's best special alloy was some cracking mixture that no one cared 
to buy. Then he had been told that he could produce Rearden Metal in the 
amount that Orren Boyle could have produced, if he could have produced it. 
Nobody had known how this was to be determined. Somebody in Washington had 



announced a figure, naming a number of tons per year, giving no reasons. 
Everybody had let it go at that. 

He had not known how to give every consumer who demanded it an equal share 
of Rearden Metal. The waiting list of orders could not be filled in three 
years, even had he been permitted to work at full capacity. New orders were 
coming in daily. They were not orders any longer, in the old, honorable sense 
of trade; they were demands. The law provided that he could be sued by any 
consumer who failed to receive his fair share of Rearden Metal. 

Nobody had known how to determine what constituted a fair share of what 
amount. Then a bright young boy just out of college had been sent to him from 
Washington, as Deputy Director of Distribution. After many telephone 
conferences with the capital, the boy announced that customers would get five 
hundred tons of the Metal each, in the order of the dates of their 
applications. Nobody had argued against his figure. 

There was no way to form an argument; the figure could have been one pound 
or one million tons, with the same validity. The boy had established an 
office at the Rearden mills, where four girls took applications for shares of 
Rearden Metal. At the present rate of the mills' 

production, the applications extended well into the next century. 

Five hundred tons of Rearden Metal could not provide three miles of rail 
for Taggart Transcontinental; it could not provide the bracing for one of Ken 
Danagger's coal mines. The largest industries, Rearden 's best customers, were 
denied the use of his Metal. But golf clubs made of Rearden Metal were 
suddenly appearing on the market, as well as coffee pots, garden tools and 
bathroom faucets. Ken Danagger, who had seen the value of the Metal and had 
dared to order it against a fury of public opinion, was not permitted to 
obtain it; his order had been left unfilled, cut off without warning by the 
new laws. Mr. Mowen, who had betrayed Taggart Transcontinental in its most 
dangerous hour, was now making switches of Rearden Metal and selling them to 
the Atlantic Southern. Rearden looked on, his emotions plugged out. 

He turned away, without a word, when anybody mentioned to him what 
everybody knew: the quick fortunes that were being made on Rearden Metal. 
"Well, no," people said in drawing rooms, "you mustn't call it a black 
market, because it isn't, really. Nobody is selling the Metal illegally. 
They're just selling their right to it. Not selling really, just pooling 
their shares." He did not want to know the insect intricacy of the deals 
through which the "shares" were sold and pooled— nor how a manufacturer in 
Virginia had produced, in two months, five thousand tons of castings made of 
Rearden Metal— nor what man in Washington was that manufacturer's unlisted 
partner . 

He knew that their profit on a ton of Rearden Metal was five times larger 
than his own. He said nothing. Everybody had a right to the Metal, except 
himself . 

The young boy from Washington— whom the steel workers had nicknamed the Wet 
Nurse— hung around Rearden with a primitive, astonished curiosity which, 
incredibly, was a form of admiration. Rearden watched him with disgusted 
amusement. The boy had no inkling of any concept of morality; it had been 
bred out of him by his college; this had left him an odd frankness, naive and 
cynical at once, like the innocence of a savage. 

"You despise me, Mr. Rearden," he had declared once, suddenly and without 
any resentment. "That's impractical." 

"Why is it impractical?" Rearden had asked. 

The boy had looked puzzled and had found no answer. He never had an answer 
to any "why?" He spoke in flat assertions. He would say about people, "He's 
old-fashioned," "He's unreconstructed," "He's unadjusted," without hesitation 
or explanation; he would also say, while being a graduate in metallurgy, 
"Iron smelting, I think, seems to require a high temperature." He uttered 



nothing but uncertain opinions about physical nature— and nothing but 
categorical imperatives about men. 

"Mr. Rearden, " he had said once, "if you feel you'd like to hand out more 
of the Metal to friends of yours— I mean, in bigger hauls— it could be 
arranged, you know. Why don't we apply for a special permission on the ground 
of essential need? I've got a few friends in Washington. Your friends are 
pretty important people, big businessmen, so it wouldn't be difficult to get 
away with the essential need dodge. Of course, there would be a few expenses. 
For things in Washington, You know how it is, things always occasion 
expenses . " 

"What things?" 

"You understand what I mean." 

"No," Rearden had said, "I don't. Why don't you explain it to me?" 
The boy had looked at him uncertainly, weighed it in his mind, then come 
out with: "It's bad psychology." 
"What is?" 

"You know, Mr. Rearden, it's not necessary to use such words as that." 
"As what?" 

"Words are relative. They're only symbols. If we don't use ugly symbols, 
we won't have any ugliness. Why do you want me to say things one way, when 
I've already said them another?" 

"Which way do I want you to say them?" 

"Why do you want me to?" 

"For the same reason that you don't." 

The boy had remained silent for a moment, then had said, "You know, Mr. 
Rearden, there are no absolute standards. We can't go by rigid principles, 
we've got to be flexible, we've got to adjust to the reality of the day and 
act on the expediency of the moment." 

"Run along, punk. Go and try to pour a ton of steel without rigid 
principles, on the expediency of the moment." 

A strange sense, which was almost a sense of style, made Rearden feel 
contempt for the boy, but no resentment. The boy seemed to fit the spirit of 
the events around them. It was as if they were being carried back across a 
long span of centuries to the age where the boy had belonged, but he, 
Rearden, had not. Instead of building new furnaces, thought Rearden, he was 
now running a losing race to keep the old ones going; instead of starting new 
ventures, new research, new experiments in the use of Rearden Metal, he was 
spending the whole of his energy on a quest for sources of iron ore: like the 
men at the dawn of the Iron Age— he thought— but with less hope. 

He tried to avoid these thoughts. He had to stand on guard against his own 
feeling— as if some part of him had become a stranger that had to be kept 
numb, and his will had to be its constant, watchful anesthetic. That part was 
an unknown of which he knew only that he must never see its root and never 
give it voice. He had lived through one dangerous moment which he could not 
allow to return. 

It was the moment when— alone in his office, on a winter evening, held 
paralyzed by a newspaper spread on his desk with a long column of directives 
on the front page— he had heard on the radio the news of Ellis Wyatt ' s flaming 
oil fields. Then, his first reaction— before any thought of the future, any 
sense of disaster, any shock, terror or protest —had been to burst out 
laughing. He had laughed in triumph, in deliverance, in a spurting, living 
exultation— and the words which he had not pronounced, but felt, were: God 
bless you, Ellis, whatever you're doing! 

When he had grasped the implications of his laughter, he had known that he 
was now condemned to constant vigilance against himself. Like the survivor of 
a heart attack, he knew that he had had a warning and that he carried within 
him a danger that could strike him at any moment. 



He had held it off, since then. He had kept an even, cautious, severely 
controlled pace in his inner steps. But it had come close to him for a 
moment, once again. When he had looked at the order of the State Science 
Institute on his desk, it had seemed to him that the glow moving over the 
paper did not come from the furnaces outside, but from the flames of a 
burning oil field. 

"Mr. Rearden, " said the Wet Nurse, when he heard about the rejected order, 
"you shouldn't have done that." 
"Why not?" 

"There's going to be trouble." 
"What kind of trouble?" 

"It's a government order. You can't reject a government order." 
"Why can't I?" 

"It's an Essential Need project, and secret, too. It's very important." 

"What kind of a project is it?" 

"I don't know. It's secret." 

"Then how do you know it's important?" 

"It said so." 

"Who said so?" 

"You can't doubt such a thing as that, Mr. Rearden!" 
"Why can't 1?" 
"But you can't." 

"If I can't, then that would make it an absolute and you said there aren't 
any absolutes." 

"That's different." 
"How is it different?" 
"It's the government." 

"You mean, there aren't any absolutes except the government?" 

"I mean, if they say it's important, then it is." 

"Why?" 

"I don't want you to get in trouble, Mr. Rearden, and you're going to, 
sure as hell. You ask too many why's. Now why do you do that?" 

Rearden glanced at him and chuckled. The boy noticed his own words and 
grinned sheepishly, but he looked unhappy. 

The man who came to see Rearden a week later was youngish and slenderish, 
but neither as young nor as slender as he tried to make himself appear. He 
wore civilian clothes and the leather leggings of a traffic cop. Rearden 
could not quite get it clear whether he came from the State Science Institute 
or from Washington. 

"I understand that you refused to sell metal to the State Science 
Institute, Mr. Rearden," he said in a soft, confidential tone of voice. 

"That's right," said Rearden. 

"But wouldn't that constitute a willful disobedience of the law?" 

"It's for you to interpret." 

"May I ask your reason?" 

"My reason is of no interest to you." 

"Oh, but of course it is! We are not your enemies, Mr. Rearden. We want to 
be fair to you. You mustn't be afraid of the fact that you are a big 
industrialist. We won't hold it against you. We actually want to be as fair 
to you as to the lowest day laborer. We would like to know your reason." 

"Print my refusal in the newspapers, and any reader will tell you my 
reason. It appeared in all the newspapers a little over a year ago." 

"Oh, no, no, no! Why talk of newspapers? Can't we settle this as a 
friendly, private matter?" 

"That's up to you." 

"We don't want this in the newspapers." 
"No?" 



"No. We wouldn't want to hurt you." 

Rearden glanced at him and asked, "Why does the State Science Institute 
need ten thousand tons of metal? What is Project X?" 

"Oh, that? It's a very important project of scientific research, an 
undertaking of great social value that may prove of inestimable public 
benefit, but, unfortunately, the regulations of top policy do not permit me 
to tell you its nature in fuller detail." 

"You know," said Rearden, "I could tell you— as my reason— that I do not 
wish to sell my Metal to those whose purpose is kept secret from me. I 
created that Metal. It is my moral responsibility to know for what purpose I 
permit it to be used." 

"Oh, but you don't have to worry about that, Mr. Rearden! We relieve you 
of the responsibility." 

"Suppose I don't wish to be relieved of it?" 

"But . . . but that is an old-fashioned and . . . and purely theoretical 
attitude . " 

"I said I could name it as my reason. But I won ' t— because, in this case, I 
have another, inclusive reason. I would not sell any Rearden Metal to the 
State Science Institute for any purpose whatever, good or bad, secret or 
open . " 

"But why?" 

"Listen," said Rearden slowly, "there might be some sort of justification 
for the savage societies in which a man had to expect that enemies could 
murder him at any moment and had to defend himself as best he could. But 
there can be no justification for a society in which a man is expected to 
manufacture the weapons for his own murderers." 

"I don't think it's advisable to use such words, Mr. Rearden. I don't 
think it's practical to think in such terms. After all, the government 
cannot— in the pursuit of wide, national policies— take cognizance of your 
personal grudge against some one particular institution." 

"Then don't take cognizance of it." 

"What do you mean?" 

"Don't come asking my reason." 

"But, Mr. Rearden, we cannot let a refusal to obey the law pass unnoticed. 
What do you expect us to do?" 
"Whatever you wish." 

"But this is totally unprecedented. Nobody has ever refused to sell an 
essential commodity to the government. As a matter of fact, the law does not 
permit you to refuse to sell your Metal to any consumer, let alone the 
government . " 

"Well, why don't you arrest me, then?" 

"Mr. Rearden, this is an amicable discussion. Why speak of such things as 
arrests ? " 

"Isn't that your ultimate argument against me?" 
"Why bring it up?" 

"Isn't it implied in every sentence of this discussion?" 
"Why name it?" 

"Why not?" There was no answer. "Arc you trying to hide from me the fact 
that if it weren't for that trump card of yours, I wouldn't have allowed you 
to enter this office?" 

"But I'm not speaking of arrests." 

"I am. 11 

"I don't understand you, Mr. Rearden." 

"I am not helping you to pretend that this is any sort of amicable 
discussion. It isn't. Now do what you please about it." 



There was a strange look on the man's face: bewilderment, as if he had no 
conception of the issue confronting him, and fear, as if he had always had 
full knowledge of it and had lived in dread of exposure. 

Rearden felt a strange excitement; he felt as if he were about to grasp 
something he had never understood, as if he were on the trail of some 
discovery still too distant to know, except that it had the most immense 
importance he had ever glimpsed. 

"Mr. Rearden" said the man, "the government needs your Metal. 

You have to sell it to us, because surely you realize that the 
government's plans cannot be held up by the matter of your consent." 

"A sale," said Rearden slowly, "requires the seller's consent." He got up 
and walked to the window. "I'll tell you what you can do." 

He pointed to the siding where ingots of Rearden Metal were being loaded 
onto freight cars. "There's Rearden Metal. Drive down there with your trucks- 
like any other looter, but without his risk, because I won't shoot you, as 
you know I can't— take as much of the Metal as you wish and go. Don't try to 
send me payment. I won't accept it. 

Don't print out a check to me. It won't be cashed. If you want that Metal, 
you have the guns to seize it. Go ahead." 

"Good God, Mr. Rearden, what would the public think!" 

It was an instinctive, involuntary cry. The muscles of Rearden 's face 
moved briefly in a soundless laughter. Both of them had understood the 
implications of that cry. Rearden said evenly, in the grave, unstrained tone 
of finality, "You need my help to make it look like a sale— like a safe, just, 
moral transaction. I will not help you." 

The man did not argue. He rose to leave. He said only, "You will regret 
the stand you've taken, Mr. Rearden." 

"I don't think so," said Rearden. 

He knew that the incident was not ended. He knew also that the secrecy of 
Project X was not the main reason why these people feared to make the issue 
public. He knew that he felt an odd, joyous, lighthearted self-confidence. He 
knew that these were the right steps down the trail he had glimpsed. 

Dagny lay stretched in an armchair of her living room, her eyes closed. 
This day had been hard, but she knew that she would see Hank Rearden tonight. 
The thought of it was like a lever lifting the weight of hours of senseless 
ugliness away from her. 

She lay still, content to rest with the single purpose of waiting quietly 
for the sound of the key in the lock. He had not telephoned her, but she had 
heard that he was in New York today for a conference with producers of 
copper, and he never left the city till next morning, nor spent a night in 
New York that was not hers. She liked to wait for him. She needed a span of 
time as a bridge between her days and his nights. 

The hours ahead, like all her nights with him, would be added, she 
thought, to that savings account of one's life where moments of time are 
stored in the pride of having been lived. The only pride of her workday was 
not that it had been lived, but that it had been survived. 

It was wrong, she thought, it was viciously wrong that one should ever be 
forced to say that about any hour of one's life. But she could not think of 
it now. She was thinking of him, of the struggle she had watched through the 
months behind them, his struggle for deliverance; she had known that she 
could help him win, but must help him in every way except in words. 

She thought of the evening last winter when he came in, took a small 
package from his pocket and held it out to her, saying, "I want you to have 
it." She opened it and stared in incredulous bewilderment at a pendant made 
of a single pear-shaped ruby that spurted a violent fire on the white satin 
of the jeweler's box. It was a famous stone, which only a dozen men in the 
world could properly afford to purchase; he was not one of them. 



"Hank . . . why?" 

"No special reason. I just wanted to see you wear it." 

"Oh, no, not a thing of this kind! Why waste it? I go so rarely to 
occasions where one has to dress. When would I ever wear it?" 

He looked at her, his glance moving slowly from her legs to her face. 
"I'll show you," he said. 

He led her to the bedroom, he took off her clothes, without a word, in the 
manner of an owner undressing a person whose consent is not required. He 
clasped the pendant on her shoulders. She stood naked, the stone between her 
breasts, like a sparkling drop of blood. 

"Do you think a man should give jewelry to his mistress for any purpose 
but his own pleasure?" he asked. "This is the way I want you to wear it. Only 
for me. I like to look at it. It's beautiful," 

She laughed; it was a soft, low, breathless sound. She could not speak or 
move, only nod silently in acceptance and obedience; she nodded several 
times, her hair swaying with the wide, circular movement of her head, then 
hanging still as she kept her head bowed to him. 

She dropped down on the bed. She lay stretched lazily, her head thrown 
back, her arms at her sides, palms pressed to the rough texture of the 
bedspread, one leg bent, the long line of the other extended across the dark 
blue linen of the spread, the stone glowing like a wound in the semi- 
darkness, throwing a star of rays against her skin. 

Her eyes were half-closed in the mocking, conscious triumph of being 
admired, but her mouth was half-open in helpless, begging expectation. He 
stood across the room, looking at her, at her flat stomach drawn in, as her 
breath was drawn, at the sensitive body of a sensitive consciousness. He 
said, his voice low, intent and oddly quiet: "Dagny, if some artist painted 
you as you are now, men would come to look at the painting to experience a 
moment that nothing could give them in their own lives. They would call it 
great art. They would not know the nature of what they felt, but the painting 
would show them everything— even that you're not some classical Venus, but the 
Vice-President of a railroad, because that's part of it— even what I am, 
because that's part of it, too. Dagny, they'd feel it and go away and sleep 
with the first barmaid in sight— and they'd never try to reach what they had 
felt. I wouldn't want to seek it from a painting. 

I'd want it real. I'd take no pride in any hopeless longing. I wouldn't 
hold a stillborn aspiration. I'd want to have it, to make it, to live it. 

Do you understand?" 

"Oh yes, Hank, 7 understand!" she said. Do you, my darling?— do you 
understand it fully?— she thought, but did not say it aloud. 

On the evening of a blizzard, she came home to find an enormous spread of 
tropical flowers standing in her living room against the dark glass of 
windows battered by snowf lakes. They were stems of Hawaiian Torch Ginger, 
three feet tall; their large heads were cones of petals that had the sensual 
texture of soft leather and the color of blood. "I saw them in a florist's 
window," he told her when he came, that night. 

"I liked seeing them through a blizzard. But there's nothing as wasted as 
an object in a public window." 

She began to find flowers in her apartment at unpredictable times, flowers 
sent without a card, but with the signature of the sender in their fantastic 
shapes, in the violent colors, in the extravagant cost. He brought her a gold 
necklace made of small hinged squares that formed a spread of solid gold to 
cover her neck and shoulders, like the collar of a knight's armor— "Wear it 
with a black dress, " he ordered. He brought her a set of glasses that were 
tall, slender blocks of square-cut crystal, made by a famous jeweler. She 
watched the way he held one of the glasses when she served him a drink— as if 
the touch of the texture under his fingers, the taste of the drink and the 



sight of her face were the single form of an indivisible moment of enjoyment. 
"I used to see things I liked, " he said, "but I never bought them. There 
didn't seem to be much meaning in it. There is, now." 

He telephoned her at the office, one winter morning, and said, not in the 
tone of an invitation, but in the tone of an executive's order, "We're going 
to have dinner together tonight, T want you to dress. Do you have any sort of 
blue evening gown? Wear it." 

The dress she wore was a slender tunic of dusty blue that gave her a look 
of unprotected simplicity, the look of a statue in the blue shadows of a 
garden under the summer sun. What he brought and put over her shoulders was a 
cape of blue fox that swallowed her from the curve of her chin to the tips of 
her sandals. "Hank, that's preposterous "—she laughed— "it ' s not my kind of 
thing!" "No?" he asked, drawing her to a mirror. 

The huge blanket of fur made her look like a child bundled for a 
snowstorm; the luxurious texture transformed the innocence of the awkward 
bundle into the elegance of a perversely intentional contrast: into a look of 
stressed sensuality. The fur was a soft brown, dimmed by an aura of blue that 
could not be seen, only felt like an enveloping mist, like a suggestion of 
color grasped not by one's eyes but by one's hands, as if one felt, without 
contact, the sensation of sinking one's palms into the fur's softness. The 
cape left nothing to be seen of her, except the brown of her hair, the blue- 
gray of her eyes, the shape of her mouth. 

She turned to him, her smile startled and helpless. "I ... I didn't know 
it would look like that." 

"I did." 

She sat beside him in his car as he drove through the dark streets of the 
city. A sparkling net of snow flashed into sight once in a while, when they 
went past the lights on the corners. She did not ask where they were going. 
She sat low in the scat, leaning back, looking up at the snowf lakes. The fur 
cape was wrapped tightly about her; within it, her dress felt as light as a 
nightgown and the feel of the cape was like an embrace. 

She looked at the angular tiers of lights rising through the snowy 
curtain, and— glancing at him, at the grip of his gloved hands on the wheel, 
at the austere, fastidious elegance of the figure in black overcoat and white 
muffler— she thought that he belonged in a great city, among polished 
sidewalks and sculptured stone. 

The car went down into a tunnel, streaked through an echoing tube of tile 
under the river and rose to the coils of an elevated highway under an open 
black sky. The lights were below them now, spread in flat miles of bluish 
windows, of smokestacks, slanting cranes, red gusts of fire, and long, dim 
rays silhouetting the contorted shapes of an industrial district. She thought 
that she had seen him once, at his mills, with smudges of soot on his 
forehead, dressed in acid-eaten overalls; he had worn them as naturally well 
as he wore his formal clothes. He belonged here, too— she thought, looking 
down at the flats of New Jersey— among the cranes, the fires and the grinding 
clatter of gears. 

When they sped down a dark road through an empty countryside, with the 
strands of snow glittering across their headlights— she remembered how he had 
looked in the summer of their vacation, dressed in slacks, stretched on the 
ground of a lonely ravine, with the grass under his body and the sun on his 
bare arms. He belonged in the countryside, she thought— he belonged 
everywhere— he was a man who belonged on earth— and then she thought of the 
words which were more exact: he was a man to whom the earth belonged, the man 
at home on earth and in control. Why, then— she wondered— should he have had to 
carry a burden of tragedy which, in silent endurance, he had accepted so 
completely that he had barely known he carried it? She knew part of the 
answer; she felt as if the whole answer were close and she would grasp it on 



some approaching day. But she did not want to think of it now, because they 
were moving away from the burdens, because within the space of a speeding car 
they held the stillness of full happiness. She moved her head imperceptibly 
to let it touch his shoulder for a moment. 

The car left the highway and turned toward the lighted squares of distant 
windows, that hung above the snow beyond a grillwork of bare branches. Then, 
in a soft, dim light, they sat at a table by a window facing darkness and 
trees. The inn stood on a knoll in the woods; it had the luxury of high cost 
and privacy, and an air of beautiful taste suggesting that it had not been 
discovered by those who sought high cost and notice. She was barely aware of 
the dining room; it blended away into a sense of superlative comfort, and the 
only ornament that caught her attention was the glitter of iced branches 
beyond the glass of the window. 

She sat, looking out, the blue fur half -slipping off her naked arms and 
shoulders. He watched her through narrowed eyes, with the satisfaction of a 
man studying his own workmanship. 

"I like giving things to you," he said, "because you don't need them." 

"No?" 

"And it's not that I want you to have them. I want you to have them from 
me . " 

"That is the way I do need them, Hank. From you." 

"Do you understand that it's nothing but vicious self-indulgence on my 
part? I'm not doing it for your pleasure, but for mine." 

"Hank!" The cry was involuntary; it held amusement, despair, indignation 
and pity. "If you'd given me those things just for my pleasure, not yours, I 
would have thrown them in your face." 

"Yes . . . Yes, then you would— and should." 

"Did you call it your vicious self-indulgence?" 

"That's what they call it." 

"Oh, yes! That's what they call it. What do you call it, Hank?" 

"I don't know," he said indifferently, and went on intently. "I know only 
that if it's vicious, then let me be damned for it but that's what I want to 
do more than anything else on earth." 

She did not answer; she sat looking straight at him with a faint smile, as 
if asking him to listen to the meaning of his own words. 

"I've always wanted to enjoy my wealth," he said. "I didn't know how to do 
it. I didn't even have time to know how much T wanted to. 

But I knew that all the steel I poured came back to me as liquid gold, and 
the gold was meant to harden into any shape I wished, and it was I who had to 
enjoy it. Only I couldn't. I couldn't find any purpose for it. I've found it, 
now. It's I who've produced that wealth and it's I who am going to let it buy 
for me every kind of pleasure I want— including the pleasure of seeing Row 
much I'm able to pay for— including the preposterous feat of turning you into 
a luxury object." 

"But I'm a luxury object that you've paid for long ago," she said; she was 
not smiling. 
"How?" 

"By means of the same values with which you paid for your mills." 

She did not know whether he understood it with that full, luminous 
finality which is a thought named in words; but she knew that what he felt in 
that moment was understanding. She saw the relaxation of an invisible smile 
in his eyes. 

"I've never despised luxury," he said, "yet I've always despised those who 
enjoyed it. I looked at what they called their pleasures and it seemed so 
miserably senseless to me— after what I felt at the mills. I used to watch 
steel being poured, tons of liquid steel running as I wanted it to, where I 
wanted it. And then I'd go to a banquet and I'd see people who sat trembling 



in awe before their own gold dishes and lace tablecloths, as if their dining 
room were the master and they were just objects serving it, objects created 
by their diamond shirt studs and necklaces, not the other way around. Then 
I'd run to the sight of the first slag heap I could find— and they'd say that 
I didn't know how to enjoy life, because I cared for nothing but business." 

He looked at the dim, sculptured beauty of the room and at the people who 
sat at the tables. They sat in a manner of self-conscious display, as if the 
enormous cost of their clothes and the enormous care of their grooming should 
have fused into splendor, but didn't. Their faces had a look of rancorous 
anxiety . 

"Dagny, look at those people. They're supposed to be the playboys of life, 
the amusement-seekers and luxury-lovers. They sit there, waiting for this 
place to give them meaning, not the other way around. 

But they're always shown to us as the enjoyers of material pleasures —and 
then we're taught that enjoyment of material pleasures is evil. 

Enjoyment? Are they enjoying it? Isn't there some sort of perversion in 
what we're taught, some error that's vicious and very important?" 

"Yes, Hank— very vicious and very, very important." 

"They are the playboys, while we're just tradesmen, you and I. Do you 
realize that we're much more capable of enjoying this place than they can 
ever hope to be?" 

"Yes . " 

He said slowly, in the tone of a quotation, "Why have we left it all to 
fools? It should have been ours." She looked at him, startled. He smiled. "I 
remember every word you said to me at that party. I didn't answer you then, 
because the only answer I had, the only thing your words meant to me, was an 
answer that you would hate me for, I thought; it was that I wanted you." He 
looked at her. "Dagny, you didn't intend it then, but what you were saying 
was that you wanted to sleep with me, wasn't it?" 

"Yes, Hank. Of course." 

He held her eyes, then looked away. They were silent for a long time. He 
glanced at the soft twilight around them, then at the sparkle of two wine 
glasses on their table. "Dagny, in my youth, when I was working in the ore 
mines in Minnesota, I thought that I wanted to reach an evening like this. 
No, that was not what I was working for, and I didn't think of it often. But 
once in a while, on a winter night, when the stars were out and it was very 
cold, when I was tired, because I had worked two shifts, and wanted nothing 
on earth except to lie down and fall asleep right there, on the mine ledge— I 
thought that some day I would sit in a place like this, where one drink of 
wine would cost more than my day's wages, and I would have earned the price 
of every minute of it and of every drop and of every flower on the table, and 
I would sit there for no purpose but my own amusement." 

She asked, smiling, "With your mistress?" 

She saw the shot of pain in his eyes and wished desperately that she had 
not said it. 

"With ... a woman," he answered. She knew the word he had not 
pronounced. He went on, his voice soft and steady: "When I became rich and 
saw what the rich did for their amusement, I thought that the place I had 
imagined, did not exist. I had not even imagined it too clearly. I did not 
know what it would be like, only what I would feel. I gave up expecting it 
years ago. But I feel it tonight." 

He raised his glass, looking at her. 

"Hank, I . . . I'd give up anything I've ever had in my life, except my 
being a ... a luxury object of your amusement." 

He saw her hand trembling as she held her glass. He said evenly, "I know 
it, dearest." 



She sat shocked and still: he had never used that word before. He threw 
his head back and smiled the most brilliantly gay smile she had ever seen on 
his face. 

"Your first moment of weakness, Dagny, " he said. 

She laughed and shook her head. He stretched his arm across the table and 
closed his hand over her naked shoulder, as if giving her an instant's 
support. Laughing softly, and as if by accident, she let her mouth brush 
against his fingers; it kept her face down for the one moment when he could 
have seen that the brilliance of her eyes was tears. 

When she looked up at him, her smile matched his— and the rest of the 
evening was their celebration— for all his years since the nights on the mine 
ledges— for all her years since the night of her first ball when, in desolate 
longing for an uncaptured vision of gaiety, she had wondered about the people 
who expected the lights and the flowers to make them brilliant. 

"Isn't there ... in what we're taught . . . some error that's vicious 
and very important?"— she thought of his words, as she lay in an armchair of 
her living room, on a dismal evening of spring, waiting for him to come. . . 
. Just a little farther, my darling— she thought- 
look a little farther and you'll be free of that error and of all the 
wasted pain you never should have had to carry. . . . But she felt that she, 
too, had not seen the whole of the distance, and she wondered what were the 
steps left for her to discover. . . . 

Walking through the darkness of the streets, on his way to her apartment, 
Rearden kept his hands in his coat pockets and his arms pressed to his sides, 
because he felt that he did not want to touch anything or brush against 
anyone. He had never experienced it before —this sense of revulsion that was 
not aroused by any particular object, but seemed to flood everything around 
him, making the city seem sodden. He could understand disgust for any one 
thing, and he could fight that thing with the healthy indignation of knowing 
that it did not belong in the world; but this was new to him— this feeling 
that the world was a loathsome place where he did not want to belong. 

He had held a conference with the producers of copper, who had just been 
garroted by a set of directives that would put them out of existence in 
another year. He had had no advice to give them, no solution to offer; his 
ingenuity, which had made him famous as the man who would always find a way 
to keep production going, had not been able to discover a way to save them. 
But they had all known that there was no way; ingenuity was a virtue of the 
mind— and in the issue confronting them, the mind had been discarded as 
irrelevant long ago. "It's a deal between the boys in Washington and the 
importers of copper," one of the men had said, "mainly d'Anconia Copper." 

This was only a small, extraneous stab of pain, he thought, a feeling of 
disappointment in an expectation he had never had the right to expect; he 
should have known that this was just what a man like Francisco d'Anconia 
would do— and he wondered angrily why he felt as if a bright, brief flame had 
died somewhere in a lightless world. 

He did not know whether the impossibility of acting had given him this 
sense of loathing, or whether the loathing had made him lose the desire to 
act. It's both, he thought; a desire presupposes the possibility of action to 
achieve it; action presupposes a goal which is worth achieving. If the only 
goal possible was to wheedle a precarious moment's favor from men who held 
guns, then neither action nor desire could exist any longer. 

Then could life?— he asked himself indifferently. Life, he thought, had 
been defined as motion; man's life was purposeful motion; what was the state 
of a being to whom purpose and motion were denied, a being held in chains but 
left to breathe and to see all the magnificence of the possibilities he could 
have reached, left to scream "Why?" and to be shown the muzzle of a gun as 



sole explanation? He shrugged, walking on; he did not care even to find an 
answer . 

He observed, indifferently, the devastation wrought by his own 
indifference. No matter how hard a struggle he had lived through in the past, 
he had never reached the ultimate ugliness of abandoning the will to act. In 
moments of suffering, he had never let pain win its one permanent victory: he 
had never allowed it to make him lose the desire for joy. He had never 
doubted the nature of the world or man's greatness as its motive power and 
its core. Years ago, he had wondered with contemptuous incredulity about the 
fanatical sects that appeared among men in the dark corners of history, the 
sects who believed that man was trapped in a malevolent universe ruled by 
evil for the sole purpose of his torture. Tonight, he knew what their vision 
of the world and their feel of it had been. If what he now saw around him was 
the world in which he lived, then he did not want to touch any part of it, he 
did not want to fight it, he was an outsider with nothing at stake and no 
concern for remaining alive much longer. 

Dagny and his wish to see her were the only exception left to him. 

The wish remained. But in a sudden shock, he realized that he felt no 
desire to sleep with her tonight. That desire— which had never given him a 
moment's rest, which had been growing, feeding on its own satisfaction— was 
wiped out. It was an odd impotence, neither of his mind nor of his body. He 
felt, as passionately as he had ever felt it, that she was the most desirable 
woman on earth; but what came from it was only a desire to desire her, a wish 
to feel, not a feeling. The sense of numbness seemed impersonal, as if its 
root were neither in him nor in her; as if it were the act of sex that now 
belonged to a realm which he had left. 

"Don't get up— stay there— it's so obvious that you've been waiting for me 
that I want to look at it longer." 

He said it, from the doorway of her apartment, seeing her stretched in an 
armchair, seeing the eager little jolt that threw her shoulders forward as 
she was about to rise; he was smiling. 

He noted— as if some part of him were watching his reactions with detached 
curiosity— that his smile and his sudden sense of gaiety were real. He grasped 
a feeling that he had always experienced, but never identified because it had 
always been absolute and immediate: a feeling that forbade him ever to face 
her in pain. It was much more than the pride of wishing to conceal his 
suffering: it was the feeling that suffering must not be granted recognition 
in her presence, that no form of claim between them should ever be motivated 
by pain and aimed at pity. It was not pity that he brought here or came here 
to find. 

"Do you still need proof that I'm always waiting for you?" she asked, 
leaning obediently back in her chair; her voice was neither tender nor 
pleading, but bright and mocking. 

"Dagny, why is it that most women would never admit that, but you do?" 

"Because they're never sure that they ought to be wanted. I am." 

"I do admire self-confidence." 

"Self-confidence was only one part of what I said, Hank." 
"What's the whole?" 

"Confidence of my value— and yours." He glanced at her as if catching the 
spark of a sudden thought, and she laughed, adding, "I wouldn't be sure of 
holding a man like Orren Boyle, for instance. He wouldn't want me at all. You 
would . " 

"Are you saying, " he asked slowly, "that I rose in your estimation when 
you found that I wanted you?" 
"Of course . " 

"That's not the reaction of most people to being wanted." 
"It isn't." 



"Most people feel that they rise in their own eyes, if others want them.". 

"I feel that others live up to me, if they want me. And that is the way 
you feel, too, Hank, about yourself— whether you admit it or not," 

That's not what I said to you then, on that first morning— he thought, 
looking down at her. She lay stretched out lazily, her face blank, but her 
eyes bright with amusement. He knew that she was thinking of it and that she 
knew he was. He smiled, but said nothing else. 

As he sat half -stretched on the couch, watching her across the room, he 
felt at peace— as if some temporary wall had risen between him and the things 
he had felt on his way here. He told her about his encounter with the man 
from the State Science Institute, because, even though he knew that the event 
held danger, an odd, glowing sense of satisfaction still remained from it in 
his mind. 

He chuckled at her look of indignation. "Don't bother being angry at 
them," he said. "It's no worse than all the rest of what they're doing every 
day. " 

"Hank, do you want me to speak to Dr. Stadler about it?" 
"Certainly not ! " 

"He ought to stop it. He could at least do that much." 

"I'd rather go to jail. Dr. Stadler? You're not having anything to do with 
him, are you?" 

"1 saw him a few days ago." 
"Why?" 

"In regard to the motor." 

"The motor . . . ?" He said it slowly, in a strange way, as if the thought 
of the motor had suddenly brought back to him a realm he had forgotten. 
"Dagny . . . the man who invented that motor . . . 

he did exist, didn't he?" 

"Why ... of course. What do you mean?" 

"I mean only that . . . that it's a pleasant thought, isn't it? Even if 
he's dead now, he was alive once ... so alive that he designed that motor. 

"What's the matter, Hank?" 
"Nothing. Tell me about the motor." 

She told him about her meeting with Dr. Stadler. She got up and paced the 
room, while speaking; she could not lie still, she always felt a surge of 
hope and of eagerness for action when she dealt with the subject of the 
motor . 

The first thing he noticed were the lights of the city beyond the window: 
he felt as if they were being turned on, one by one, forming the great 
skyline he loved; he felt it, even though he knew that the lights had been 
there all the time. Then he understood that the thing which was returning was 
within him: the shape coming back drop by drop was his love for the city. 
Then he knew that it had come back because he was looking at the city past 
the taut, slender figure of a woman whose head was lifted eagerly as at a 
sight of distance, whose steps were a restless substitute for flight. He was 
looking at her as at a stranger, he was barely aware that she was a woman, 
but the sight was flowing into a feeling the words for which were: This is 
the world and the core of it, this is what made the city— they go together, 
the angular shapes of the buildings and the angular lines of a face stripped 
of everything but purpose— the rising steps of steel and the steps of a being 
intent upon his goal— this is what they had been, all the men who had lived to 
invent the lights, the steel, the furnaces, the motors— 

they were the world, they, not the men who crouched in dark corners, half- 
begging, half-threatening, boastfully displaying their open sores as their 
only claim on life and virtue— so long as he knew that there existed one man 
with the bright courage of a new thought, could he give up the world to those 



others?— so long as he could find a single sight to give him a life-restoring 
shot of admiration, could he believe that the world belonged to the sores, 
the moans and the guns?— the men who invented motors did exist, he would never 
doubt their reality, it was his vision of them that had made the contrast- 
unbearable, so that even the loathing was the tribute of his loyalty to them 
and to that world which was theirs and his. 

"Darling . . ."he said, "darling . . ." like a man awakening suddenly, 
when he noticed that she had stopped speaking. 

"What's the matter, Hank?" she asked softly. 

"Nothing . . . Except that you shouldn't have called Stadler." His face 
was bright with confidence, his voice sounded amused, protective and gentle; 
she could discover nothing else, he looked as he had always looked, it was 
only the note of gentleness that seemed strange and new. 

"I kept feeling that I shouldn't have," she said, "but I didn't know why." 

"I'll tell you why." He leaned forward. "What he wanted from you was a 
recognition that he was still the Dr, Robert Stadler he should have been, but 
wasn't and knew he wasn't. He wanted you to grant him your respect, in spite 
of and in contradiction to his actions. He wanted you to juggle reality for 
him, so that his greatness would remain, but the State Science Institute 
would be wiped out, as if it had never existed— and you're the only one who 
could do it for him." 

"Why I?" 

"Because you're the victim." 

She looked at him, startled. He spoke intently; he felt a sudden, violent 
clarity of perception, as if a surge of energy were rushing into the activity 
of sight, fusing the half-seen and haft-grasped into a single shape and 
direction . 

"Dagny, they're doing something that we've never understood. They know 
something which we don't, but should discover. I can't see it fully yet, but 
I'm beginning to see parts of it. That looter from the State Science 
Institute was scared when I refused to help him pretend that he was just an 
honest buyer of my Metal. He was scared way deep. Of what? I don't know- 
public opinion was just his name for it, but it's not the full name. Why 
should he have been scared? He has the guns, the jails, the laws— he could 
have seized the whole of my mills, if he wished, and nobody would have risen 
to defend me, and he knew it— so why should he have cared what I thought? But 
he did. 

It was I who had to tell him that he wasn't a looter, but my customer and 
friend. That's what he needed from me. And that's what Dr. Stadler needed 
from you— it was you who had to act as if he were a great man who had never 
tried to destroy your rail and my Metal. I don't know what it is that they 
think they accomplish— but they want us to pretend that we sec the world as 
they pretend they see it. They need some sort of sanction from us. I don't 
know the nature of that sanction— but . Dagny, I know that if we value our 
lives, we must not give it to them. If they put you on a torture rack, don't 
give it to them. Let them destroy your railroad and my mills, but don't give 
it to them. Because I know this much: I know that that's our only chance." 

She had remained standing still before him, looking attentively at the 
faint outline of some shape she, too, had tried to grasp. 

"Yes . . ." she said, "yes, I know what you've seen in them. . . . 

I've felt it, too— but it's only like something brushing past that's gone 
before I know I've seen it, like a touch of cold air, and what's left is 
always the feeling that I should have stopped it. . . .1 know that you're 
right. I can't understand their game, but this much is right: We must not see 
the world as they want us to see it. It's some sort of fraud, very ancient 
and very vast— and the key to break it is: to check every premise they teach 
us, to question every precept, to—" 



She whirled to him at a sudden thought, but she cut the motion and the 
words in the same instant: the next words- would have been the ones she did 
not want to say to him. She stood looking at him with a slow, bright smile of 
curiosity . 

Somewhere within him, he knew the thought she would not name, but he knew 
it only in that prenatal shape which has to find its words in the future. He 
did not pause to grasp it now— because in the flooding brightness of what he 
felt, another thought, which was its predecessor, had become clear to him and 
had been holding him for many minutes past. He rose, approached her and took 
her in his arms. 

He held the length of her body pressed to his, as if their bodies were two 
currents rising upward together, each to a single point, each carrying the 
whole of their consciousness to the meeting of their lips. 

What she felt in that moment contained, as one nameless part of it, the 
knowledge of the beauty in the posture of his body as he held her, as they 
stood in the middle of a room high above the lights of the city. 

What he knew, what he had discovered tonight, was that his recaptured love 
of existence had not been given back to him by the return of his desire for 
her— but that the desire had returned after he had regained his world, the 
love, the value and the sense of his world— 

and that the desire was not an answer to her body, but a celebration of 
himself and of his will to live. 

He did not know it, he did not think of it, he was past the need of words, 
but in the moment when he felt the response of her body to his, he felt also 
the unadmitted knowledge that that which he had called her depravity was her 
highest virtue— this capacity of hers to feel the joy of being, as he felt it. 



CHAPTER II 
THE ARISTOCRACY OF PULL 



The calendar in the sky beyond the window of her office said: September 2. 
Dagny leaned wearily across her desk. The first light to snap on at the 
approach of dusk was always the ray that hit the calendar; when the white- 
glowing page appeared above the roofs, it blurred the city, hastening the 
darkness . 

She had looked at that distant page every evening of the months behind 
her. Your days are numbered, it had seemed to say— as if it were marking a 
progression toward something it knew, but she didn't. Once, it had clocked 
her race to build the John Gait Line; now it was clocking her race against an 
unknown destroyer. 

One by one, the men who had built new towns in Colorado, had departed into 
some silent unknown, from which no voice or person had yet returned. The 
towns they had left were dying. Some of the factories they built had remained 
ownerless and locked; others had been seized by the local authorities; the 
machines in both stood still. 

She had felt as if a dark map of Colorado were spread before her like a 
traffic control panel, with a few lights scattered through its mountains. One 
after another, the lights had gone out. One after another, the men had 
vanished. There had been a pattern about it, which she felt, but could not 
define; she had become able to predict, almost with certainty, who would go 
next and when; she was unable to grasp the "why?" 

Of the men who had once greeted her descent from the cab of an engine on 
the platform of Wyatt Junction, only Ted Nielsen was left, still running the 
plant of Nielsen Motors. "Ted, you won't be the next one to go?" she had 
asked him, on his recent visit to New York; she had asked it, trying to 
smile. He had answered grimly, "I hope not." 

"What do you mean, you hope?— aren't you sure?" He had said slowly, 
heavily, "Dagny, I've always thought that I'd rather die than stop working. 
But so did the men who ' re gone. It seems impossible to me that I could ever 
want to quit. But a year ago, it seemed impossible that they ever could. 
Those men were my friends. They knew what their going would do to us, the 
survivors. They would not have gone like that, without a word, leaving to us 
the added terror of the inexplicable— unless they had some reason of supreme 
importance. A month ago, Roger Marsh, of Marsh Electric, told me that he'd 
have himself chained to his desk, so that he wouldn't be able to leave it, no 
matter what ghastly temptation struck him. He was furious with anger at the 
men who'd left. He swore to me that he'd never do it. 

'And if it's something that I can't resist, ' he said, 'I swear that I'll 
keep enough of my mind to leave you a letter and give you some hint of what 
it is, so that you won't have to rack your brain in the kind of dread we're 
both feeling now.' That's what he swore. Two weeks ago, he went. He left me 
no letter. . . . Dagny, I can't tell what I'll do when I see it— whatever it 
was that they saw when they went." 

It seemed to her that some destroyer was moving soundlessly through the 
country and the lights were dying at his touch— someone, she thought bitterly, 
who had reversed the principle of the Twentieth Century motor and was now 
turning kinetic energy into static. 

That was the enemy— she thought, as she sat at her desk in the gathering 
twilight— with whom she was running a race. The monthly report from Quentin 
Daniels lay on her desk. She could not be certain, as yet, that Daniels would 
solve the secret of the motor; but the destroyer, she thought, was moving 
swiftly, surely, at an ever accelerating tempo; she wondered whether, by the 
time she rebuilt the motor, there would be any world left to use it. 



She had liked Quentin Daniels from the moment he entered her office on 
their first interview. He was a lanky man in his early thirties, with a 
homely, angular face and an attractive smile. A hint of the smile remained in 
his features at all times, particularly when he listened; it was a look of 
good-natured amusement, as if he were swiftly and patiently discarding the 
irrelevant in the words he heard and going straight to the point a moment 
ahead of the speaker. 

"Why did you refuse to work for Dr. Stadler?" she asked. 

The hint of his smile grew harder and more stressed; this was as near as 
he came to showing an emotion; the emotion was anger. But he answered in his 
even, unhurried drawl, "You know, Dr. Stadler once said that the first word 
of 'Free, scientific inquiry' was redundant. 

He seems to have forgotten it. Well, I'll just say that 'Governmental 
scientific inquiry' is a contradiction in terms." 

She asked him what position he held at the Utah Institute of Technology. 
"Night watchman," he answered. "What?" she gasped. "Night watchman," he 
repeated politely, as if she had not caught the words, as if there were no 
cause for astonishment. 

Under her questioning, he explained that he did not like any of the 
scientific foundations left in existence, that he would have liked a job in 
the research laboratory of some big industrial concern— "But which one of them 
can afford to undertake any long-range work nowadays, and why should they?"— 
so when the Utah Institute of Technology was closed for lack of funds, he had 
remained there as night watchman and sole inhabitant of the place; the salary 
was sufficient to pay for his needs— and the Institute's laboratory was there, 
intact, for his own private, undisturbed use. 

"So you're doing research work of your own?" 

"That's right." 

"For what purpose?" 

"For my own pleasure." 

"What do you intend to do, if you discover something of scientific 
importance or commercial value? Do you intend to put it to some public use?" 
"I don't know. I don't think so." 

"Haven't you any desire to be of service to humanity?" 

"I don't talk that kind of language, Miss Taggart. I don't think you do, 
either . " 

She laughed. "I think we'll get along together, you and I." 
"We will." 

When she had told him the story of the motor, when he had studied the 
manuscript, he made no comment, but merely said that he would take the job on 
any terms she named. 

She asked him to choose his own terms. She protested, in astonishment, 
against the low monthly salary he quoted. "Miss Taggart," he said, "if 
there's something that I won't take, it's something for nothing. 

I don't know how long you might have to pay me, or whether you'll get 
anything at all in return. I'll gamble on my own mind. I won't let anybody 
else do it. I don't collect for an intention. But I sure do intend to collect 
for goods delivered. If I succeed, that's when I'll skin you alive, because 
what I want then is a percentage, and it's going to be high, but it's going 
to be worth your while." 

When he named the percentage he wanted, she laughed. "That is skinning me 
alive and it will be worth my while. Okay." 

They agreed that it was to be her private project and that he was to be 
her private employee; neither of them wanted to have to deal with the 
interference of the Taggart Research Department. He asked to remain in Utah, 
in his post of watchman, where he had all the laboratory equipment and all 



the privacy he needed. The project was to remain confidential between them, 
until and unless he succeeded. 

"Miss Taggart, " he said in conclusion, "I don't know how many years it 
will take me to solve this, if ever. But I know that if I spend the rest of 
my life on it and succeed, I will die satisfied." He added, "There's only one 
thing that I want more than to solve it: it's to meet the man who has." 

Once a month, since his return to Utah, she had sent him a check and he 
had sent her a report on his work. It was too early to hope, but his reports 
were the only bright points in the stagnant fog of her days in the office. 

She raised her head, as she finished reading his pages. The calendar in 
the distance said: September 2. The lights of the city had grown beneath it, 
spreading and glittering. She thought of Rearden. She wished he were in the 
city; she wished she would sec him tonight. 

Then, noticing the date, she remembered suddenly that she had to rush home 
to dress, because she had to attend Jim's wedding tonight. 

She had not seen Jim, outside the office, for over a year. She had not met 
his fiancee, but she had read enough about the engagement in the newspapers. 
She rose from her desk in wearily distasteful resignation: it seemed easier 
to attend the wedding than to bother explaining her absence afterwards. 

She was hurrying across the concourse of the Terminal when she heard a 
voice calling, "Miss Taggart!" with a strange note of urgency and reluctance, 
together. It stopped her abruptly; she took a few seconds to realize that it 
was the old man at the cigar stand who had called. 

"I've been waiting to catch sight of you for days. Miss Taggart. I've been 
extremely anxious to speak to you." There was an odd expression on his face, 
the look of an effort not to look frightened. 

"I'm sorry," she said, smiling, "I've been rushing in and out of the 
building all week and didn't have time to stop." 

He did not smile. "Miss Taggart, that cigarette with the dollar sign that 
you gave me some months ago— where did you get it?" 

She stood still for a moment. "I'm afraid that's a long, complicated 
story," she answered. 

"Have you any way of getting in touch with the person who gave it to you?" 

"I suppose so— though I'm not too sure. Why?" 

"Would he tell you where he got it?" 

"I don't know. What makes you suspect that he wouldn't?" 

He hesitated, then asked, "Miss Taggart, what do you do when you have to 
tell someone something which you know to be impossible?" 

She chuckled. 'The man who gave me the cigarette said that in such a case 
one must check one's premises." 

"He did? About the cigarette?" 

"Well, no, not exactly. But why? What is it you have to tell me?" 

"Miss Taggart, I have inquired all over the world. I have checked every 
source of information in and about the tobacco industry. I have had that 
cigarette stub put through a chemical analysis. There is no plant that 
manufactures that kind of paper. The flavoring elements in that tobacco have 
never been used in any smoking mixture I could find. That cigarette was 
machine-made, but it was not made in any factory I know— and I know them all. 
Miss Taggart, to the best of my knowledge, that cigarette was not made 
anywhere on earth." 

Rearden stood by, watching absently, while the waiter wheeled the dinner 
table out of his hotel room. Ken Danagger had left. The room was half-dark; 
by an unspoken agreement, they had kept the lights low during their dinner, 
so that Danagger 's face would not be noticed and, perhaps, recognized by the 
waiters . 

They had had to meet furtively, like criminals who could not be seen 
together. They could not meet in their offices or in their homes, only in the 



crowded anonymity of a city, in his suite at the Wayne Falkland Hotel. There 
could be a fine of $10,000 and ten years of imprisonment for each of them, if 
it became known that he had agreed to deliver to Danagger four thousand tons 
of structural shapes of Rearden Metal. 

They had not discussed that law, at their dinner together, or their 
motives or the risk they were taking. They had merely talked business. 

Speaking clearly and dryly, as he always spoke at any conference, Danagger 
had explained that half of his original order would be sufficient to brace 
such tunnels as would cave in, if he delayed the bracing much longer, and to 
recondition the mines of the Confederated Coal Company, gone bankrupt, which 
he had purchased three weeks ago— 

"It's an excellent property, bat in rotten condition; they had a nasty 
accident there last month, cave-in and gas explosion, forty men killed." 

He had added, in the monotone of reciting some impersonal, statistical 
report, "The newspapers are yelling that coal is now the most crucial 
commodity in the country. They are also yelling that the coal operators are 
profiteering on the oil shortage. One gang in Washington is yelling that I am 
expanding too much and something should be done to stop me, because I am 
becoming a monopoly. Another gang in Washington is yelling that I am not 
expanding enough and something should be done to let the government seize my 
mines, because I am greedy for profits and unwilling to satisfy the public's 
need of fuel. At my present rate of profit, this Confederated Coal property 
will bring back the money I spent on it— in forty-seven years. I have no 
children. I bought it, because there's one customer I don't dare leave 
without coal —and that's Taggart Transcontinental. I keep thinking of what 
would happen if the railroads collapsed." He had stopped, then added, "T 

don't know why I still care about that, but I do. Those people in 
Washington don't seem to have a clear picture of what that would be like. I 
have." Rearden had said, "I'll deliver the Metal. When you need the other 
half of your order, let me know. I'll deliver that, too." 

At the end of the dinner, Danagger had said in the same precise, impassive 
tone, the tone of a man who knows the exact meaning of his words, "If any 
employee of yours or mine discovers this and attempts private blackmail, I 
will pay it, within reason. But I will not pay, if he has friends in 
Washington. If any of those come around, then I go to jail." "Then we go 
together," Rearden had said. 

Standing alone in his half-darkened room, Rearden noted that the prospect 
of going to jail left him blankly indifferent. He remembered the time when, 
aged fourteen, faint with hunger, he would not steal fruit from a sidewalk 
stand. Now, the possibility of being sent to jail— H this dinner was a felony- 
meant no more to him than the possibility of being run over by a truck: an 
ugly physical accident without any moral significance. 

He thought that he had been made to hide, as a guilty secret, the only 
business transaction he had enjoyed in a year's work— and that he was hiding, 
as a guilty secret, his nights with Dagny, the only hours that kept him 
alive. He felt that there was some connection between the two secrets, some 
essential connection which he had to discover. He could not grasp it, he 
could not find the words to name it, but he felt that the day when he would 
find them, he would answer every question of his life. 

He stood against the wall, his head thrown back, his eyes closed, and 
thought of Dagny, and then he felt that no questions could matter to him any 
longer. He thought that he would see her tonight, almost hating it, because 
tomorrow morning seemed so close and then he would have to leave her— he 
wondered whether he could remain in town tomorrow, or whether he should leave 
now, without seeing her, so that he could wait, so that he could always have 
it ahead of him: the moment of closing his hands over her shoulders and 
looking down at her face. You're going insane, he thought— but he knew that if 



she were beside him through every hour of his days, it would still be the 
same, he would never have enough of it, he would have to invent some 
senseless form of torture for himself in order to bear it— he knew he would 
see her tonight, and the thought of leaving without it made the pleasure 
greater, a moment's torture to underscore his certainty of the hours ahead. 
He would leave the light on in her living room, he thought, and hold her 
across the bed, and see nothing but the curve of the strip of light running 
from her waist to her ankle, a single line drawing the whole shape of her 
long, slim body in the darkness, then he would pull her head into the light, 
to see her face, to see it falling back, unresisting, her hair over his arm. 
her eyes closed, the face drawn as in a look of pain, her mouth open to him. 

He stood at the wall, waiting, to let all the events of the day drop away 
from him, to feel free, to know that the next span of time was his. 

When the door of his room flew open without warning, he did not quite hear 
or believe it, at first. He saw the silhouette of a woman, then of a bellboy 
who put down a suitcase and vanished. The voice he heard was Lillian's: "Why, 
Henry! All alone and in the dark?" 

She pressed a light switch by the door. She stood there, fastidiously 
groomed, wearing a pale beige traveling suit that looked as if she had 
traveled under glass; she was smiling and pulling her gloves off with the air 
of having reached home. 

"Are you in for the evening, dear?" she asked. "Or were you going out?" 

He did not know how long a time passed before he answered, "What are you 
doing here?" 

"Why, don't you remember that Jim Taggart invited us to his wedding? It's 
tonight . " 

"I didn't intend to go to his wedding." 
"Oh, but I did!" 

"Why didn't you tell me this morning, before I left?" 

"To surprise you, darling." She laughed gaily. "It's practically 
impossible to drag you to any social function, but I thought you might do it 
like this, on the spur of the moment, just to go out and have a good time, as 
married couples are supposed to. I thought you wouldn't mind it— you've been 
staying overnight in New York so often!" 

He saw the casual glance thrown at him from under the brim of her 
fashionably tilted hat. He said nothing. 

"Of course, I was running a risk," she said. "You might have been taking 
somebody out to dinner." He said nothing. "Or were you, perhaps, intending to 
return home tonight?" 

"No. " 

"Did you have an engagement for this evening?" 
"No . " 

"Fine." She pointed at her suitcase. "I brought my evening clothes. 
Will you bet me a corsage of orchids that I can get dressed faster than 
you can?" 

He thought that Dagny would be at her brother's wedding tonight; the 
evening did not matter to him any longer. "I'll take you out, if you wish," 
he said, "but not to that wedding." 

"Oh, but that's where I want to go ! It's the most preposterous event of 
the season, and everybody's been looking forward to it for weeks, all my 
friends. I wouldn't miss it for the world. There isn't any better show in 
town— nor better publicized. It's a perfectly ridiculous marriage, but just 
about what you'd expect from Jim Taggart." 

She was moving casually through the room, glancing around, as if getting 
acquainted with an unfamiliar place. "I haven't been in New York for years," 
she said. "Not with you, that is. Not on any formal occasion." 



He noticed the pause in the aimless wandering of her eyes, a glance that 
stopped briefly on a filled ashtray and moved on. He felt a stab of 
revulsion . 

She saw it in his face and laughed gaily. "Oh but, darling, I'm not 
relieved! I'm disappointed. I did hope I'd find a few cigarette butts smeared 
with lipstick." 

He gave her credit for the admission of the spying, even if under cover of 
a joke. But something in the stressed frankness of her manner made him wonder 
whether she was joking; for the flash of an instant, he felt that she had 
told him the truth. He dismissed the impression, because he could not 
conceive of it as possible. 

"I'm afraid that you'll never be human," she said. "So I'm sure that I 
have no rival. And if I have— which I doubt, darling— I don't think I'll worry 
about it, because if it's a person who's always available on call, without 
appointment— well , everybody knows what sort of a person that is." 

He thought that he would have to be careful; he had been about to slap her 
face. "Lillian, I think you know," he said, "that humor of this kind is more 
than I can stand." 

"Oh, you're so serious!" she laughed. "I keep forgetting it. You're so 
serious about everything— particularly yourself." 

Then she whirled to him suddenly, her smile gone. She had the strange, 
pleading look which he had seen in her face at times, a look that seemed made 
of sincerity and courage: "You prefer to be serious, Henry? All right. How 
long do you wish me to exist somewhere in the basement of your life? How 
lonely do you want me to become? I've asked nothing of you. I've let you live 
your life as you pleased. Can't you give me one evening? Oh, I know you hate 
parties and you'll be bored. But it means a great deal to me. Call it empty, 
social vanity— I want to appear, for once, with my husband. I suppose you 
never think of it in such terms, but you're an important man, you're envied, 
hated, respected and feared, you're a man whom any woman would be proud to 
show off as her husband. 

You may say it's a low form of feminine ostentation, but that's the form 
of any woman's happiness. You don't live by such standards, but I do. Can't 
you give me this much, at the price of a few hours of boredom? Can't you be 
strong enough to fulfill your obligation and to perform a husband's duty? 
Can't you go there, not for your own sake, but mine, not because you want to 
go, but only because I want it?" 

Dagny— he thought desperately— Dagny, who had never said a word about his 
life at home, who had never made a claim, uttered a reproach or asked a 
question— he could not appear before her with his wife, he could not let her 
see him as the husband being proudly shown off— he wished he could die now, in 
this moment, before he committed this action— because he knew that he would 
commit it. 

Because he had accepted his secret as guilt and promised himself to take 
its consequences— because he had granted that the right was with Lillian, and 
he was able to bear any form of damnation, but not able to deny the right 
when it was claimed of him— because he knew that the reason for his refusal to 
go, was the reason that gave him no right to refuse— because he heard the 
pleading cry in his mind: "Oh God, Lillian, anything but that party!" and he 
did not allow himself to beg for mercy— 

—he said evenly, his voice lifeless and firm: "All right, Lillian. I'll 
go. " 

The wedding veil of rose-point lace caught on the splintered floor of her 
tenement bedroom. Cherryl Brooks lifted it cautiously, stepping to look at 
herself in a crooked mirror that hung on the wall. She had been photographed 
here all day, as she had been many times in the past two months. She still 



smiled with incredulous gratitude when newspaper people wanted to take her 
picture, but she wished they would not do it so often. 

An aging sob sister, who had a drippy love column in print and the bitter 
wisdom of a policewoman in person, had taken Cherryl under her protection 
weeks ago, when the girl had first been thrown into press interviews as into 
a meat grinder. Today, the sob sister had chased the reporters out, had 
snapped, "All right, all right, beat it!" at the neighbors, had slammed 
Cherryl ' s door in their faces and had helped her to dress. She was to drive 
Cherryl to the wedding; she had discovered that there was no one else to do 
it. 

The wedding veil, the white satin gown, the delicate slippers and the 
strand of pearls at her throat, had cost five hundred times the price of the 
entire contents of Cherryl ' s room. A bed took most of the room's space, and 
the rest was taken by a chest of drawers, one chair, and her few dresses 
hanging behind a faded curtain. The huge hoop skirt of the wedding gown 
brushed against the walls when she moved, her slender figure swaying above 
the skirt in the dramatic contrast of a tight, severe, long-sleeved bodice; 
the gown had been made by the best designer in the city. 

"You see, when I got the job in the dime store, I could have moved to a 
better room," she said to the sob sister, in apology, "but I don't think it 
matters much where you sleep at night, so I saved my money, because I'll need 
it for something important in the future—" 

She stopped and smiled, shaking her head dazedly. "I thought I'd need it," 
she said. 

"You look fine," said the sob sister. "You can't see much in that alleged 
mirror, but you're okay." 

"The way all this happened, I ... I haven't had time to catch up with 
myself. But you see, Jim is wonderful. He doesn't mind it, that I'm only a 
salesgirl from a dime store, living in a place like this. He doesn't hold it 
against me." 

"Uh-huh, " said the sob sister; her face looked grim. 

Cherryl remembered the wonder of the first time Jim Taggart had come here. 
He had come one evening, without warning, a month after their first meeting, 
when she had given up hope of ever seeing him again. She had been miserably 
embarrassed, she had felt as if she were trying to hold a sunrise within the 
space of a mud puddle— but Jim had smiled, sitting on her only chair, looking 
at her flushed face and at her room. Then he had told her to put on her coat, 
and he had taken her to dinner at the most expensive restaurant in the city. 

He had smiled at her uncertainty, at her awkwardness, at her terror of 
picking the wrong fork, and at the look of enchantment in her eyes. 

She had not known what he thought. But he had known that she was stunned, 
not by the place, but by his bringing her there, that she barely touched the 
costly food, that she took the dinner, not as booty from a rich sucker— as all 
the girls he knew would have taken it— but as some shining award she had never 
expected to deserve. 

He had come back to her two weeks later, and then their dates had grown 
progressively more frequent. He would drive up to the dime store at the 
closing hour, and she would see her fellow salesgirls gaping at her, at his 
limousine, at the uniformed chauffeur who opened the door for her. He would 
take her to the best night clubs, and when he introduced her to his friends, 
he would say, "Miss Brooks works in the dime store in Madison Square." She 
would see the strange expressions on their faces and Jim watching them with a 
hint of mockery in his eyes. He wanted to spare her the need of pretense or 
embarrassment, she thought with gratitude. He had the strength to be honest 
and not to care whether others approved of him or not, she thought with 
admiration. But she felt an odd, burning pain, new to her, the night she 



heard some woman, who worked for a highbrow political magazine, say to her 
companion at the next table, "How generous of Jim!" 

Had he wished, she would have given him the only kind of payment she could 
offer in return. She was grateful that he did not seek it. But she felt as if 
their relationship was an immense debt and she had nothing to pay it with, 
except her silent worship. He did not need her worship, she thought. 

There were evenings when he came to take her out, but remained in her 
room, instead, and talked to her, while she listened in silence. It always 
happened unexpectedly, with a kind of peculiar abruptness, as if he had not 
intended doing it, but something burst within him and he had to speak. Then 
he sat slumped on her bed, unaware of his surroundings and of her presence, 
yet his eyes jerked to her face once in a while, as if he had to be certain 
that a living being heard him. 

". . .it wasn't for myself, it wasn't for myself at all— why won't they 
believe me, those people? I had to grant the unions' demands to cut down the 
trains— and the moratorium on bonds was the only way I could do it, so that's 
why Wesley gave it to me, for the workers, not for myself. AH the newspapers 
said that I was a great example for all businessmen to follow— a businessman 
with a sense of social responsibility. That's what they said. It's true, 
isn't it? . . . Isn't it? . . . 

What was wrong about that moratorium? What if we did skip a few 
technicalities? It was for a good purpose. Everyone agrees that anything you 
do is good, so long as it's not for yourself. . . . But she won't give me 
credit for a good purpose. She doesn't think anybody's any good except 
herself. My sister is a ruthless, conceited bitch, who won't take anyone's 
ideas but her own. . . . Why do they keep looking at me that way— she and 
Rearden and all those people? Why are they so sure they're right? . . . If I 
acknowledge their superiority in the material realm, why don't they 
acknowledge mine in the spiritual? 

They have the brain, but I have the heart. They have the capacity to 
produce wealth, but I have the capacity to love. Isn't mine the greater 
capacity? Hasn't it been recognized as the greatest through all the centuries 
of human history? Why won't they recognize it? . . . Why are they so sure 
they're great? . . . And if they're great and I'm not —isn't that exactly why 
they should bow to me, because I'm not? 

Wouldn't that be an act of true humanity? It takes no kindness to respect 
a man who deserves respect— it's only a payment which he's earned. To give an 
unearned respect is the supreme gesture of charity. 

. . . But they're incapable of charity. They're not human. They feel no 
concern for anyone's need ... or weakness. No concern . . . and no pity . . 

She could understand little of it, but she understood that he was unhappy 
and that somebody had hurt him. He saw the pain of tenderness in her face, 
the pain of indignation against his enemies, and he saw the glance intended 
for heroes— given to him by a person able to experience the emotion behind 
that glance. 

She did not know why she felt certain that she was the only one to whom he 
could confess his torture. She took it as a special honor, as one more gift. 

The only way to be worthy of him, she thought, was never to ask him for 
anything. He offered her money once, and she refused it, with such a bright, 
painful flare of anger in her eyes that he did not attempt it again. The 
anger was at herself: she wondered whether she had done something to make him 
think she was that kind of person. 

But she did not want to be ungrateful for his concern, or to embarrass him 
by her ugly poverty; she wanted to show him her eagerness to rise and justify 
his favor; so she told him that he could help her, if he wished, by helping 



her to find a better job. He did not answer. In the weeks that followed, she 
waited, but he never mentioned the subject. 

She blamed herself: she thought that she had offended him, that he had 
taken it as an attempt to use him. 

When he gave her an emerald bracelet, she was too shocked to understand. 
Trying desperately not to hurt him, she pleaded that she could not accept it. 
"Why not?" he asked. "It isn't as if you were a bad woman paying the usual 
price for it. Are you afraid that I'll start making demands? Don't you trust 
me?" He laughed aloud at her stammering embarrassment. He smiled, with an odd 
kind of enjoyment, all through the evening when they went to a night club and 
she wore the bracelet with her shabby black dress. 

He made her wear that bracelet again, on the night when he took her to a 
party, a great reception given by Mrs. Cornelias Pope. If he considered her 
good enough to bring into the home of his friends, she thought— the 
illustrious friends whose names she had seen on the inaccessible mountain 
peaks that were the society columns of the newspapers— she could not embarrass 
him by wearing her old dress. She spent her year's savings on an evening gown 
of bright green chiffon with a low neckline, a belt of yellow roses and a 
rhinestone buckle. When she entered the stern residence, with the cold, 
brilliant lights and a terrace suspended over the roofs of skyscrapers, she 
knew that her dress was wrong for the occasion, though she could not tell 
why. But she kept her posture proudly straight and she smiled with the 
courageous trust of a kitten when it sees a hand extended to play: people 
gathered to have a good time would not hurt anyone, she thought. 

At the end of an hour, her attempt to smile had become a helpless, 
bewildered plea. Then the smile went, as she watched the people around her. 
She saw that the trim, confident girls had a nasty insolence of manner when 
they spoke to Jim, as if they did not respect him and never had. One of them 
in particular, a Betty Pope, the daughter of the hostess, kept making remarks 
to him which Cherryl could not understand, because she could not believe that 
she understood them correctly. 

No one had paid any attention to her, at first, except for a few 
astonished glances at her gown. After a while, she saw them looking at her. 
She heard an elderly woman ask Jim, in the anxious tone of referring to some 
distinguished family she had missed knowing, "Did you say Miss Brooks of 
Madison Square?" She saw an odd smile on Jim's face, when he answered, making 
his voice sound peculiarly clear, "Yes —the cosmetics counter of Raleigh's 
Five and Ten." Then she saw some people becoming too polite to her, and 
others moving away in a pointed manner, and most of them being senselessly 
awkward in simple bewilderment, and Jim watching silently with that odd 
smile . 

She tried to get out of the way, out of their notice. As she slipped by, 
along the edge of the room, she heard some man say, with a shrug, "Well, Jim 
Taggart is one of the most powerful men in Washington at the moment." He did 
not say it respectfully. 

Out on the terrace, where it was darker, she heard two men talking and 
wondered why she felt certain that they were talking about her. 

One of them said, "Taggart can afford to do it, if he pleases" and the 
other said something about the horse of some Roman emperor named Caligula. 

She looked at the lone straight shaft of the Taggart Building rising in 
the distance— and then she thought that she understood: these people hated Jim 
because they envied him. Whatever they were, she thought, whatever their 
names and their money, none of them had an achievement comparable to his, 
none of them had defied the whole country to build a railroad everybody 
thought impossible. For the first time, she saw that she did have something 
to offer Jim: these people were as mean and small as the people from whom she 



had escaped in Buffalo; he was as lonely as she had always been, and the 
sincerity of her feeling was the only recognition he had found. 

Then she walked back into the ballroom, cutting straight through the 
crowd, and the only thing left of the tears she had tried to hold back in the 
darkness of the terrace, was the fiercely luminous sparkle of her eyes. If he 
wished to stand by her openly, even though she was only a shop girl, if he 
wished to flaunt it, if he had brought her here to face the indignation of 
his friends— then it was the gesture of a courageous man defying their 
opinion, and she was willing to match his courage by serving as the scarecrow 
of the occasion. 

But she was glad when it was over, when she sat beside him in his car, 
driving home through the darkness. She felt a bleak kind of relief, Her 
battling defiance ebbed into a strange, desolate feeling; she tried not to 
give way to it. Jim said little; he sat looking sullenly out the car window; 
she wondered whether she had disappointed him in some manner. 

On the stoop of her rooming house, she said to him forlornly, "I'm sorry 
if I let you down . . ." 

He did not answer for a moment, and then he asked, "What would you say if 
I asked you to marry me?" 

She looked at him, she looked around them— there was a filthy mattress 
hanging on somebody's window sill, a pawnshop across the street, a garbage 
pail at the stoop beside them— one did not ask such a question in such a 
place, she did not know what it meant, and she answered, "I guess I ... I 
haven't any sense of humor." 

"This is a proposal, my dear." 

Then this was the way they reached their first kiss— with tears running 
down her face, tears unshed at the party, tears of shock, of happiness, of 
thinking that this should be happiness, and of a low, desolate voice telling 
her that this was not the way she would have wanted it to happen. 

She had not thought about the newspapers, until the day when Jim told her 
to come to his apartment and she found it crowded with people who had 
notebooks, cameras and flash bulbs. When she saw her picture in the papers 
for the first time— a picture of them together, Jim's arm around her— she 
giggled with delight and wondered proudly whether every person in the city 
had seen it. After a while, the delight vanished. 

They kept photographing her at the dime-store counter, in the subway, on 
the stoop of the tenement house, in her miserable room. She would have taken 
money from Jim now and run to hide in some obscure hotel for the weeks of 
their engagement— but he did not offer it. 

He seemed to want her to remain where she was. They printed pictures of 
Jim at his desk, in the concourse of the Taggart Terminal, by the steps of 
his private railway car, at a formal banquet in Washington. 

The huge spreads of full newspaper pages, the articles in magazines, the 
radio voices, the newsreels, all were a single, long, sustained scream— about 
the "Cinderella Girl" and the "Democratic Businessman." 

She told herself not to be suspicious, when she felt uneasy; she told 
herself not to be ungrateful, when she felt hurt. She felt it only in a few 
rare moments, when she awakened in the middle of the night and lay in the 
silence of her room, unable to sleep. She knew that it would take her years 
to recover, to believe, to understand. She was reeling through her days like 
a person with a sunstroke, seeing nothing but the figure of Jim Taggart as 
she had seen him first on the night of his great triumph. 

"Listen, kid, " the sob sister said to her, when she stood in her room for 
the last time, the lace of the wedding veil streaming like crystal foam from 
her hair to the blotched planks of the floor. "You think that if one gets 
hurt in life, it's through one's own sins— and that's true, in the long run. 
But there are people who'll try to hurt you through the good they see in you— 



knowing that it's the good, needing it and punishing you for it. Don't let it 
break you when you discover that." 

"I don't think I'm afraid," she said, looking intently straight before 
her, the radiance of her smile melting the earnestness of her glance. "I have 
no right to be afraid of anything. I'm too happy. You sec, I always thought 
that there wasn't any sense in people saying that all you can do in life is 
suffer. I wasn't going to knuckle down to that and give up. 

I thought that things could happen which were beautiful and very great. 

I didn't expect it to happen to me— not so much and so soon. But I'll try 
to live up to it." 

"Money is the root of all evil," said James Taggart. "Money can't buy 
happiness. Love will conquer any barrier and any social distance. That may be 
a bromide, boys, but that's how I feel." 

He stood under the lights of the ballroom of the Wayne-Falkland Hotel, in 
a circle of reporters who had closed about him the moment the wedding 
ceremony ended. He heard the crowd of guests beating like a tide beyond the 
circle. Cherryl stood beside him, her white gloved hand on the black of his 
sleeve. She was still trying to hear the words of the ceremony, not quite 
believing that she had heard them. 

"How do you feel, Mrs. Taggart?" 

She heard the question from somewhere in the circle of reporters. It was 
like the jolt of returning to consciousness: two words suddenly made 
everything real to her. She smiled and whispered, choking, "I . . . 

I'm very happy . . ." 

At opposite ends of the ballroom, Orren Boyle, who seemed too stout for 
his full-dress clothes, and Bertram Scudder, who seemed too meager for his, 
surveyed the crowd of guests with the same thought, though neither of them 
admitted that he was thinking it. Orren Boyle half-told himself that he was 
looking for the faces of friends, and Bertram Scudder suggested to himself 
that he was gathering material for an article. But both, unknown to each 
other, were drawing a mental chart of the faces they saw, classifying them 
under two headings which, if named, would have read: "Favor" and "Fear." 
There were men whose presence signified a special protection extended to 
James Taggart, and men whose presence confessed a desire to avoid his 
hostility— those who represented a hand lowered to pull him up, and those who 
represented a back bent to let him climb. By the unwritten code of the day, 
nobody received or accepted an invitation from a man of public prominence 
except in token of one or the other of these motives. 

Those in the first group were, for the most part, youthful; they had come 
from Washington. Those in the second group were older; they were businessmen. 

Orren Boyle and Bertram Scudder were men who used words as a public 
instrument, to be avoided in the privacy of one's own mind. 

Words were a commitment, carrying implications which they did not wish to 
face. They needed no words for their chart; the classification was done by 
physical means: a respectful movement of their eyebrows, equivalent to the 
emotion of the word "So!" for the first group— and a sarcastic movement of 
their lips, equivalent to the emotion of "Well, well!" for the second. One 
face blew up the smooth working of their calculating mechanisms for a moment: 
when they saw the cold blue eyes and blond hair of Hank Rearden, their 
muscles tore at the register of the second group in the equivalent of "Oh, 
boy!" The sum of the chart was an estimate of James Taggart ' s power. It added 
up to an impressive total. 

They knew that James Taggart was fully aware of it, when they saw him 
moving among his guests. He walked briskly, in a Morse code pattern of short 
dashes and brief stops, with a manner of faint irritation, as if conscious of 
the number of people whom his displeasure might worry. The hint of a smile on 
his face had a flavor of gloating— 



as if he knew that the act of coming to honor him was an act that 
disgraced the men who had come; as if he knew and enjoyed it. 

A tail of figures kept trailing and shifting behind him, as if their 
function were to give him the pleasure of ignoring them. Mr. Mowen flickered 
briefly among the tail, and Dr. Pritchett, and Balph Eubank. 

The most persistent one was Paul Larkin. He kept describing circles around 
Taggart, as if trying to acquire a suntan by means of an occasional ray, his 
wistful smile pleading to be noticed. 

Taggart ' s eyes swept over the crowd once in a while, swiftly and 
furtively, in the manner of a prowler's flashlight; this, in the muscular 
shorthand legible to Orren Boyle, meant that Taggart was looking for someone 
and did not want anyone to know it. The search ended when Eugene Lawson came 
to shake Taggart 's hand and to say, his wet lower lip twisting like a cushion 
to soften the blow, "Mr. Mouch couldn't come, Jim, Mr. Mouch is so sorry, he 
had a special plane chartered, but at the last minute things came up, crucial 
national problems, you know." Taggart stood still, did not answer and 
frowned . 

Orren Boyle burst out laughing. Taggart turned to him so sharply that the 
others melted away without waiting for a command to vanish. 
"What do you think you're doing?" snapped Taggart. 

"Having a good time, Jimmy, just having a good time," said Boyle. "Wesley 
is your boy, wasn't he?" 

"I know somebody who's my boy and he'd better not forget it." 

"Who? Larkin? Well, no, I don't think you're talking about Larkin. 

And if it's not Larkin that you're talking about, why then I think you 
ought to be careful in your use of the possessive pronouns. I don't mind the 
age classification, I know I look young for my years, but I'm just allergic 
to pronouns . " 

"That's very smart, but you're going to get too smart one of these days." 

"If I do, you just go ahead and make the most of it, Jimmy. If." 

"The trouble with people who overreach themselves is that they have short 
memories. You'd better remember who got Rearden Metal choked off the market 
for you . " 

"Why, I remember who promised to. That was the party who then pulled every 
string he could lay his hands on to try to prevent that particular directive 
from being issued, because he figured he might need rail of Rearden Metal in 
the future . " 

"Because you spent ten thousand dollars pouring liquor into people you 
hoped would prevent the directive about the bond moratorium!" 

"That's right. So I did. I had friends who had railroad bonds. And 
besides, I have friends in Washington, too, Jimmy. Well, your friends beat 
mine on that moratorium business, but mine beat yours on Rearden Metal— and 
I'm not forgetting it. But what the hell!— it's all right with me, that's the 
way to share things around, only don't you try to fool me, Jimmy. Save the 
act for the suckers." 

"If you don't believe that I've always tried to do my best for you—" 

"Sure, you have. The best that could be expected, all things considered. 
And you'll continue to do it, too, so long as I've got somebody you need— and 
not a minute longer. So I just wanted to remind you that I've got my own 
friends in Washington. Friends that money can't buy— just like yours, Jimmy." 

"What do you think you mean?" 

"Just what you're thinking. The ones you buy aren't really worth a damn, 
because somebody can always offer them more, so the field's wide open to 
anybody and it's just like old-fashioned competition again. 

But if you get the goods on a man, then you've got him, then there's no 
higher bidder and you can count on his friendship. Well, you have friends, 
and so have I. You have friends I can use, and vice versa. 



That's all right with me— what the hell!— one's got to trade something. 
If we don't trade money— and the age of money is past— then we trade men." 
"What is it you're driving at?" 

"Why, I'm just telling you a few things that you ought to remember. 

Now take Wesley, for instance. You promised him the assistant's job in the 
Bureau of National Planning— for double-crossing Rearden, at the time of the 
Equalization of Opportunity Bill. You had the connections to do it, and 
that's what I asked you to do— in exchange for the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule, 
where I had the connections. So Wesley did his part, and you saw to it that 
you got it all on paper— oh sure, I know that you've got written proof of the 
kind of deals he pulled to help pass that bill, while he was taking Rearden 's 
money to defeat it and keeping Rearden off guard. They were pretty ugly 
deals. It would be pretty messy for Mr. Mouch, if it all came out in public. 
So you kept your promise and you got the job for him, because you thought you 
had him. And so you did. And he paid off pretty handsomely, didn't he? But it 
works only just so long. After a while, Mr. Wesley Mouch might get to be so 
powerful and the scandal so old, that nobody will care how he got his start 
or whom he double-crossed. Nothing lasts forever. Wesley was Rearden 's man, 
and then he was your man, and he might be somebody else's man tomorrow " 

"Are you giving me a hint?" 

"Why no, I'm giving you a friendly warning. We're old friends. 

Jimmy, and I think that that's what we ought to remain. I think we can be 
very useful to each other, you and I, if you don't start getting the wrong 
ideas about friendship. Me— I believe in a balance of power." 

"Did you prevent Mouch from coming here tonight?" 

"Well, maybe I did and maybe I didn't. I'll let you worry about it. 

That's good for me, if I did— and still better, if I didn't." 

Cherryl ' s eyes followed James Taggart through the crowd. The faces that 
kept shifting and gathering around her seemed so friendly and their voices 
were so eagerly warm that she felt certain there was no malice anywhere in 
the room. She wondered why some of them talked to her about Washington, in a 
hopeful, confidential manner of half sentences, half-hints, as if they were 
seeking her help for something secret she was supposed to understand. She did 
not know what to say, but she smiled and answered whatever she pleased. She 
could not disgrace the person of "Mrs. Taggart" by any touch of fear. 

Then she saw the enemy. It was a tall, slender figure in a gray evening 
gown, who was now her sister-in-law. 

The pressure of anger in Cherryl ' s mind was the stored accumulation of the 
sounds of Jim's tortured voice. She felt the nagging pull of a duty left 
undone. Her eyes kept returning to the enemy and studying her intently. The 
pictures of Dagny Taggart in the newspapers had shown a figure dressed in 
slacks, or a face with a slanting hat brim and a raised coat collar. Now she 
wore a gray evening gown that seemed indecent, because it looked austerely 
modest, so modest that it vanished from one's awareness and left one too 
aware of the slender body it pretended to cover. There was a tone of blue in 
the gray cloth that went with the gun-metal gray of her eyes. She wore no 
jewelry, only a bracelet on her wrist, a chain of heavy metal links with a 
green blue cast. 

Cherryl waited, until she saw Dagny standing alone, then tore forward, 
cutting resolutely across the room. She looked at close range into the gun- 
metal eyes that seemed cold and intense at once, the eyes that looked at her 
directly with a polite, impersonal curiosity. 

"There's something I want you to know," said Cherryl, her voice taut and 
harsh, "so that there won't be any pretending about it. I'm not going to put 
on the sweet relative act. I know what you've done to Jim and how you've made 
him miserable all his life. I'm going to protect him against you. I'll put 
you in your place. I'm Mrs. Taggart. I'm the woman in this family now." 



"That's quite all right," said Dagny. "I'm the man." 

Cherryl watched her walk away, and ihoug'ritl that Jim had been right: 
this sister of his was a creature of cold evil who had given her no response, 
no acknowledgment, no emotion of any kind except a touch of something that 
looked like an astonished, indifferent amusement. 

Rearden stood by Lillian's side and followed her when she moved. 

She wished to be seen with her husband; he was complying. He did not know 
whether anyone looked at him or not; he was aware of no one around them, 
except the person whom he could not permit himself to see. 

The image still holding his consciousness was the moment when he had 
entered this room with Lillian and had seen Dagny looking at them. He had 
looked straight at her, prepared to accept any blow her eyes would choose to 
give him. Whatever the consequences to Lillian, he would have confessed his 
adultery publicly, there and in that moment, rather than commit the 
unspeakable act of evading Dagny 's eyes, of closing his face into a coward's 
blankness, of pretending to her that he did not know the nature of his 
action . 

But there had been no blow. He knew every shade of sensation ever 
reflected in Dagny 's face; he had known that she had felt no shock; he had 
seen nothing but an untouched serenity. Her eyes had moved to his, as if 
acknowledging the full meaning of this encounter, but looking at him as she 
would have looked anywhere, as she looked at him in his office or in her 
bedroom. It had seemed to him that she had stood before them both, at the 
distance of a few steps, revealed to them as simply and openly as the gray 
dress revealed her body. 

She had bowed to them, the courteous movement of her head including them 
both. He had answered, he had seen Lillian's brief nod, and then he had seen 
Lillian moving away and realized that he had stood with his head bowed for a 
long moment. 

He did not know what Lillian's friends were saying to him or what he was 
answering. As a man goes step by step, trying not to think of the length of a 
hopeless road, so he went moment by moment, keeping no imprint of anything in 
his mind. He heard snatches of Lillian's pleased laughter and a tone of 
satisfaction in her voice. 

After a while, he noticed the women around him; they all seemed to 
resemble Lillian, with the same look of static grooming, with thin eyebrows 
plucked to a static lift and eyes frozen in static amusement. He noticed that 
they were trying to flirt with him, and that Lillian watched it as if she 
were enjoying the hopelessness of their attempts. This, then —he thought— was 
the happiness of feminine vanity which she had begged him to give her, these 
were the standards which he did not live by, but had to consider. He turned 
for escape to a group of men. 

He could not find a single straight statement in the conversation of the 
men; whatever subject they seemed to be talking about never seemed to be the 
subject they were actually discussing. He listened like a foreigner who 
recognized some of the words, but could not connect them into sentences. A 
young man, with a look of alcoholic insolence, staggered past the group and 
snapped, chuckling, "Learned your lesson, Rearden?" He did not know what the 
young rat had meant; everybody else seemed to know it; they looked shocked 
and secretly pleased. 

Lillian drifted away from him, as if letting him understand that she did 
not insist upon his literal attendance. He retreated to a corner of the room 
where no one would see him or notice the direction of his eyes. Then he 
permitted himself to look at Dagny. 

He watched the gray dress, the shifting movement of the soft cloth when 
she walked, the momentary pauses sculptured by the cloth, the shadows and the 
light. He saw it as a bluish-gray smoke held shaped for an instant into a 



long curve that slanted forward to her knee and back to the tip of her 
sandal. He knew every facet the light would shape if the smoke were ripped 
away . 

He felt a murky, twisting pain: it was jealousy of every man who spoke to 
her. He had never felt it before; but he felt it here, where everyone had the 
right to approach her, except himself. 

Then, as if a single, sudden blow to his brain blasted a moment's shift of 
perspective, he felt an immense astonishment at what he was doing here and 
why. He lost, for that moment, all the days and dogmas of his past; his 
concepts, his problems, his pain were wiped out; he knew only— as from a 
great, clear distance— that man exists for the achievement of his desires, and 
he wondered why he stood here, he wondered who had the right to demand that 
he waste a single irreplaceable hour of his life, when his only desire was to 
seize the slender figure in gray and hold her through the length of whatever 
time there was left for him to exist. 

In the next moment, he felt the shudder of recapturing his mind. He felt 
the tight, contemptuous movement of his lips pressed together in token of the 
words he cried to himself: You made a contract once, now stick to it. And 
then he thought suddenly that in business transactions the courts of law did 
not recognize a contract wherein no valuable consideration had been given by 
one party to the other. He wondered what made him think of it. The thought 
seemed irrelevant. He did not pursue it. 

James Taggart saw Lillian Rearden drift casually toward him at the one 
moment when he chanced to be alone in the dim corner between a potted palm 
and a window. He stopped and waited to let her approach. 

He could not guess her purpose, but this was the manner which, in the code 
he understood, meant that he had better hear her. 

"How do you like my wedding gift, Jim?" she asked, and laughed at his look 
of embarrassment. "No, no, don't try to go over the list of things in your 
apartment, wondering which one the hell it was. It's not in your apartment, 
it's right here, and it's a non-material gift, darling." 

He saw the half-hint of a smile on her face, the look understood among his 
friends as an invitation to share a secret victory; it was the look, not of 
having outthought, but of having outsmarted somebody. 

He answered cautiously, with a safely pleasant smile, "Your presence is 
the best gift you could give me." 

"My presence, Jim?" 

The lines of his face were shock-bound for a moment. He knew what she 
meant, but he had not expected her to mean it. 

She smiled openly. "We both know whose presence is the most valuable one 
for you tonight— and the unexpected one. Didn't you really think of giving me 
credit for it? I'm surprised at you. I thought you had a genius for 
recognizing potential friends." 

He would not commit himself; he kept his voice carefully neutral. 

"Have I failed to appreciate your friendship, Lillian?" 

"Now, now, darling, you know what I'm talking about. You didn't expect him 
to come here, you didn't really think that he is afraid of you, did you? But 
to have the others think he is— that's quite an inestimable advantage, isn't 
it?" 

"I'm . . . surprised, Lillian." 

"Shouldn't you say 'impressed'? Your guests are quite impressed. I can 
practically hear them thinking all over the room. Most of them are thinking: 
'If he has to seek terms with Jim Taggart, we'd better toe the line. ' And a 
few are thinking: 'If he's afraid, we'll get away with much more.' This is as 
you want it, of course— and I wouldn't think of spoiling your triumph— but you 
and I are the only ones who know that you didn't achieve it single-handed." 



He did not smile; he asked, his face blank, his voice smooth, but with a 
carefully measured hint of harshness, "What's your angle?" 

She laughed. "Essentially— the same as yours, Jim. But speaking 
practically— none at all. It's just a favor I've done you, and I need no favor 
in return. Don't worry, I'm not lobbying for any special interests, I'm not 
after squeezing some particular directive out of Mr. Mouch, I'm not even 
after a diamond tiara from you. Unless, of course, it's a tiara of a non- 
material order, such as your appreciation." 

He looked straight at her for the first time, his eyes narrowed, his face 
relaxed to the same half-smile as hers, suggesting the expression which, for 
both of them, meant that they felt at home with each other: an expression of 
contempt. "You know that I have always admired you, Lillian, as one of the 
truly superior women." 

"I'm aware of it." There was the faintest coating of mockery spread, like 
shellac, over the smooth notes of her voice. 

He was studying her insolently. "You must forgive me if I think that some 
curiosity is permissible between friends," he said, with no tone of apology. 
"I'm wondering from what angle you contemplate the possibility of certain 
financial burdens— or losses— which affect your own personal interests." 

She shrugged. "From the angle of a horsewoman, darling. If you had the 
most powerful horse in the world, you would keep it bridled down to the Gait 
required to carry you in comfort, even though this meant the sacrifice of its 
full capacity, even though its top speed would never be seen and its great 
power would be wasted. You would do it— 

because if you let the horse go full blast, it would throw you off in no 
time. . . . However, financial aspects are not my chief concern —nor yours, 
Jim. " 

"t did underestimate you," he said slowly. 

"Oh, well, that's an error I'm willing to help you correct. I know the 
sort of problem he presents to you. I know why you're afraid of him, as you 
have good reason to be. But . . . well, you're in business and in politics, 
so I'll try to say it in your language. A businessman says that he can 
deliver the goods, and a ward heeler says that he can deliver the vote, is 
that right? Well, what I wanted you to know is that I can deliver him, any 
time I choose. You may act accordingly." 

In the code of his friends, to reveal any part of one's self was to give a 
weapon to an enemy— but he signed her confession and matched it, when he said, 
"I wish I were as smart about my sister." 

She looked at him without astonishment; she did not find the words 
irrelevant. "Yes, there's a tough one," she said. "No vulnerable point? 

No weaknesses?" 

"None. " 

"No love affairs?" 
"God, no!" 

She shrugged, in sign of changing the subject; Dagny Taggart was a person 
on whom she did not care to dwell. "I think I'll let you run along, so that 
you can chat a little with Balph Eubank," she said. "He looks worried, 
because you haven't looked at him all evening and he's wondering whether 
literature will be left without a friend at court." 

"Lillian, you're wonderful!" he said quite spontaneously. 

She laughed. "That, my dear, is the non-material tiara I wanted!" 

The remnant of a smile stayed on her face as she moved through the crowd, 
a fluid smile that ran softly into the look of tension and boredom worn by 
all the faces around her. She moved at random, enjoying the sense of being 
seen, her eggshell satin gown shimmering like heavy cream with the motion of 
her tall figure. 



It was the green-blue spark that caught her attention: it flashed for an 
instant under the lights, on the wrist of a thin, naked arm. Then she saw the 
slender body, the gray dress, the fragile, naked shoulders. She stopped. She 
looked at the bracelet, frowning. 

Dagny turned at her approach. Among the many things that Lillian resented, 
the impersonal politeness of Dagny' s face was the one she resented most. 

"What do you think of your brother's marriage, Miss Taggart?" she asked 
casually, smiling. 

"I have no opinion about it." 

"Do you mean to say that you don't find it worthy of any thought?" 
"If you wish to be exact— yes, that's what I mean." 
"Oh, but don't you see any human significance in it?" 
"No . " 

"Don't you think that a person such as your brother's bride does deserve 
some interest?" 
"Why, no." 

"I envy you, Miss Taggart. I envy your Olympian detachment. It is, I 
think, the secret of why lesser mortals can never hope to equal your success 
in the field of business. They allow their attention to be divided— at least 
to the extent of acknowledging achievements in other fields." 

"What achievements are we talking about?" 

"Don't you grant any recognition at all to the women who attain unusual 
heights of conquest, not in the industrial, but in the human realm?" 

"I don't think that there is such a word as ' conquest ' —in the human 
realm. " 

"Oh, but consider, for instance, how hard other women would have had to 
work— if work were the only means available to them— to achieve what this girl 
has achieved through the person of your brother." 

"1 don't think she knows the exact nature of what she has achieved." 

Rearden saw them together. He approached. He felt that he had to hear it, 
no matter what the consequences. He stopped silently beside them. He did not 
know whether Lillian was aware of his presence; he knew that Dagny was. 

"Do show a little generosity toward her, Miss Taggart," said Lillian. 

"At least, the generosity of attention. You must not despise the women who 
do not possess your brilliant talent, but who exercise their own particular 
endowments. Nature always balances her gifts and offers compensations— don ' t 
you think so?" 

"I'm not sure I understand you." 

"Oh, I'm sure you don't want to hear me become more explicit!" 
"Why, yes, I do." 

Lillian shrugged angrily; among the women who were her friends, she would 
have been understood and stopped long ago; but this was an adversary new to 
her— a woman who refused to be hurt. She did not care to speak more clearly, 
but she saw Rearden looking at her. 

She smiled and said, "Well, consider your sister-in-law, Miss Taggart. 

What chance did she have to rise in the world? None— by your exacting 
standards. She could not have made a successful career in business. 

She does not possess your unusual mind. Besides, men would have made it 
impossible for her. They would have found her too attractive. 

So she took advantage of the fact that men have standards which, 
unfortunately, are not as high as yours. She resorted to talents which, I'm 
sure, you despise. You have never cared to compete with us lesser women in 
the sole field of our ambition— in the achievement of power over men." 

"If you call it power, Mrs. Rearden— then, no, I haven't." 

She turned to go, but Lillian's voice stopped her: "I would like to 
believe that you're fully consistent, Miss Taggart, and fully devoid of human 
frailties. I would like to believe that you've never felt the desire to 



flatter— or to of fend— anyone . But I see that you expected both Henry and me to 
be here tonight." 

"Why, no, I can't say that I did, I had not seen my brother's guest list." 
"Then why are you wearing that bracelet?" 

Dagny's eyes moved deliberately straight to hers. "I always wear it." 
"Don't you think that that's carrying a joke too far?" 
"It was never a joke, Mrs. Rearden." 

"Then you'll understand me if I say that I'd like you to give that 
bracelet back to me." 

"I understand you. But (will not give it back." 

Lillian let a moment pass, as if to let them both acknowledge the meaning 
of their silence. For once, she held Dagny's glance without smiling. "What do 
you expect me to think, Miss Taggart?" 

"Anything you wish." 

"What is your motive?" 

"You knew my motive when you gave me the bracelet." 

Lillian glanced at Rearden. His face was expressionless; she saw no 
reaction, no hint of intention to help her or stop her, nothing but an 
attentiveness that made her feel as if she were standing in a spotlight. 

Her smile came back, as a protective shield, an amused, patronizing smile, 
intended to convert the subject into a drawing-room issue again. "I'm sure, 
Miss Taggart, that you realize how enormously improper this is." 

"No . " 

"But surely you know that you are taking a dangerous and ugly risk." 
"No . " 

"You do not take into consideration the possibility of being . . . 
misunderstood? " 
"No . " 

Lillian shook her head in smiling reproach. "Miss Taggart, don't you think 
that this is a case where one cannot afford to indulge in abstract theory, 
but must consider practical reality?" 

Dagny would not smile. "I have never understood what is meant by a 
statement of that kind." 

"I mean that your attitude may be highly idealistic— as I am sure it is— 
but, unfortunately, most people do not share your lofty frame of mind and 
will misinterpret your action in the one manner which would be most abhorrent 
to you." 

"Then the responsibility and the risk will be theirs, not mine." 

"I admire your . . . no, I must not say 'innocence, ' but shall I say 
'purity?' You have never thought of it, I'm sure, but life is not as straight 
and logical as . . . as a railroad track. It is regrettable, but possible, 
that your high intentions may lead people to suspect things which . . . well, 
which I'm sure you know to be of a sordid and scandalous nature." 

Dagny was looking straight at her. "I don't." 

"But you cannot ignore that possibility." 

"I do." Dagny turned to go. 

"Oh, but should you wish to evade a discussion if you have nothing to 
hide?" Dagny stopped. "And if your brilliant— and reckless courage permits you 
to gamble with your reputation, should you ignore the danger to Mr. Rearden?" 

Dagny asked slowly, "What is the danger to Mr. Rearden?" 

' Tm sure you understand me." 

"I don't." 

"Oh, but surely it isn't necessary to be more explicit." 
"It is— if you wish to continue this discussion." 

Lillian's eyes went to Rearden 's face, searching for some sign to help her 
decide whether to continue or to stop. He would not help her. 



"Miss Taggart" she said, "I am not your equal in philosophical altitude. I 
am only an average wife. Please give me that bracelet— if you do not wish me 
to think what I might think and what you wouldn't want me to name." 

"Mrs. Rearden, is this the manner and place in which you choose to suggest 
that I am sleeping with your husband?" 

"Certainly not!" The cry was immediate; it had a sound of panic and the 
quality of an automatic reflex, like the jerk of withdrawal of a pickpocket's 
hand caught in action. She added, with an angry, nervous chuckle, in a tone 
of sarcasm and sincerity that confessed a reluctant admission of her actual 
opinion, "That would be the possibility farthest from my mind." 

"Then you will please apologize to Miss Taggart," said Rearden. 

Dagny caught her breath, cutting off all but the faint echo of a gasp. 

They both whirled to him. Lillian saw nothing in "his face; Dagny saw 
torture . 

"It isn't necessary, Hank," she said. 

"It is— for me, " he answered coldly, not looking at her; he was looking at 
Lillian in the manner of a command that could not be disobeyed. 

Lillian studied his face with mild astonishment, but without anxiety or 
anger, like a person confronted by a puzzle of no significance. 

"But of course, " she said complaisantly, her voice smooth and confident 
again. "Please accept my apology, Miss Taggart, if I gave you the impression 
that I suspected the existence of a relationship which I would consider 
improbable for you and— from my knowledge of his inclinations— impossible for 
my husband." 

She turned and walked away indifferently, leaving them together, as if in 
deliberate proof of her words. 

Dagny stood still, her eyes closed; she was thinking of the night when 
Lillian had given her the bracelet. He had taken his wife's side, then; he 
had taken hers, now. Of the three of them, she was the only one who 
understood fully what this meant. 

"Whatever is the worst you may wish to say to me, you will be right." 

She heard him and opened her eyes. He was looking at her coldly, his face 
harsh, allowing no sign of pain or apology to suggest a hope of forgiveness. 

"Dearest, don't torture yourself like that," she said. "I knew that you're 
married. I've never tried to evade that knowledge. I'm not hurt by it 
tonight, " 

Her first word was the most violent of the several blows he felt: she had 
never used that word before. She had never let him hear that particular tone 
of tenderness. She had never spoken of his marriage in the privacy of their 
meetings— yet she spoke of it here with effortless simplicity. 

She saw the anger in his face— the rebellion against pity— the look of 
saying to her contemptuously that he had betrayed no torture and needed no 
help— then the look of the realization that she knew his face as thoroughly as 
he knew hers— he closed his eyes, he inclined his head a little, and he said 
very quietly, "Thank you." 

She smiled and turned away from him. 

James Taggart held an empty champagne glass in his hand and noticed the 
haste with which Balph Eubank waved at a passing waiter, as if the waiter 
were guilty of an unpardonable lapse. Then Eubank completed his sentence: "— 
but you, Mr. Taggart, would know that a man who lives on a higher plane 
cannot be understood or appreciated. It's a hopeless struggle— trying to 
obtain support for literature from a world ruled by businessmen. They are 
nothing but stuffy, middle-class vulgarians or else predatory savages like 
Rearden . " 

"Jim, " said Bertram Scudder, slapping his shoulder, "the best compliment I 
can pay you is that you're not a real businessman!" 



"You're a man of culture, Jim," said Dr. Pritchett, "you're not an ex-ore- 
digger like Rearden. I don't have to explain to you the crucial need of 
Washington assistance to higher education." 

"You really liked my last novel, Mr. Taggart?" Balph Eubank kept asking. 
"You really liked it?" 

Orren Boyle glanced at the group, on his way across the room, but did not 
stop. The glance was sufficient to give him an estimate of the nature of the 
group's concerns. Fair enough, he thought, one's got to trade something. He 
knew, but did not care to name just what was being traded. 

"We arc at the dawn of a new age, " said James Taggart, from above the rim 
of his champagne glass. "We are breaking up the vicious tyranny of economic 
power. We will set men free of the rule of the dollar. We will release our 
spiritual aims from dependence on the owners of material means. We will 
liberate our culture from the stranglehold of the profit-chasers. We will 
build a society dedicated to higher ideals, and we will replace the 
aristocracy of money by—" 

"—the aristocracy of pull," said a voice beyond the group. 

They whirled around. The man who stood facing them was Francisco 
d ' Anconia . 

His face looked tanned by a summer sun, and his eyes were the exact color 
of the sky on the kind of day when he had acquired his tan. 

His smile suggested a summer morning. The way he wore his formal clothes 
made the rest of the crowd look as if they were masquerading in borrowed 
costumes . 

"What's the matter?" he asked in the midst of their silence. "Did I say 
something that somebody here didn't know?" 

"How did you get here?" was the first thing James Taggart found himself 
able to utter. 

"By plane to Newark, by taxi from there, then by elevator from my suite 
fifty-three floors above you." 

"I didn't mean . . . that is, what I meant was—" 

"Don't look so startled, James. If I land in New York and hear that 
there's a party going on, I wouldn't miss it, would I? You've always said 
that I'm just a party hound." 

The group was watching them. 

"I'm delighted to see you, of course," Taggart said cautiously, then added 
belligerently, to balance it, "But if you think you're going to—" 

Francisco would not pick up the threat; he let Taggart 's sentence slide 
into mid-air and stop, then asked politely, "If I think what?" 

"You understand me very well." 

"Yes. I do. Shall I tell you what I think?" 

"This is hardly the moment for any—" 

"I think you should present me to your bride, James. Your manners have 
never been glued to you too solidly— you always lose them in an emergency, and 
that's the time when one needs them most." 

Turning to escort him toward Cherryl, Taggart caught the faint sound that 
came from Bertram Scudder; it was an unborn chuckle. Taggart knew that the 
men who had crawled at his feet a moment ago, whose hatred for Francisco 
d'Anconia was, perhaps, greater than his own, were enjoying the spectacle 
none the less. The implications of this knowledge were among the things he 
did not care to name. 

Francisco bowed to Cherryl and offered his best wishes, as if she were the 
bride of a royal heir. Watching nervously, Taggart felt relief— 

and a touch of nameless resentment, which, if named, would have told him 
he wished the occasion deserved the grandeur that Francisco's manner gave it 
for a moment. 



He was afraid to remain by Francisco's side and afraid to let him loose 
among the guests, He backed a few tentative steps away, but Francisco 
followed him, smiling. 

"You didn't think I'd want to miss your wedding, James— when you're my 
childhood friend and best stockholder?" 

"What?" gasped Taggart, and regretted it: the sound was a confession of 
panic . 

Francisco did not seem to take note of it; he said, his voice gaily 
innocent, "Oh, but of course I know it. I know the stooge behind the stooge 
behind every name on the list of the stockholders of d'Anconia Copper. It's 
surprising how many men by the name of Smith and Gomez are rich enough to own 
big chunks of the richest corporation in the world— so you can't blame me if I 
was curious to learn what distinguished persons I actually have among my 
minority stockholders. I seem to be popular with an astonishing collection of 
public figures from all over the world— from People's States where you 
wouldn't think there's any money left at all." 

Taggart said dryly, frowning, "There are many reasons— business reasons— why 
it is sometimes advisable not to make one's investments directly." 

"One reason is that a man doesn't want people to know he's rich. 

Another is that he doesn't want them to learn how he got that way." 

"I don't know what you mean or why you should object." 

"Oh, I don't object at all. I appreciate it. A great many investors —the 
old-fashioned sort— dropped me after the San Sebastian Mines. 

It scared them away. But the modern ones had more faith in me and acted as 
they always do— on faith. I can't tell you how thoroughly I appreciate it." 

Taggart wished Francisco would not talk so loudly; he wished people would 
not gather around them. "You have been doing extremely well," he said, in the 
safe tone of a business compliment. 

"Yes, haven't I? It's wonderful how the stock of d'Anconia Copper has 
risen within the last year. But I don't think I should be too conceited about 
it— there's not much competition left in the world, there's no place to invest 
one's money, if one happens to get rich quickly, and here's d'Anconia Copper, 
the oldest company on earth, the one that's been the safest bet for 
centuries. Just think of what it managed to survive through the ages. So if 
you people have decided that it's the best place for your hidden money, that 
it can't be beaten, that it would take a most unusual kind of man to destroy 
d'Anconia Copper— you were right." 

"Well, I hear it said that you've begun to take your responsibilities 
seriously and that you've settled down to business at last. They say you've 
been working very hard, " 

"Oh, has anybody noticed that? It was the old-fashioned investors who made 
it a point to watch what the president of a company was doing. The modern 
investors don't find knowledge necessary. I don't think they ever look into 
my activities." 

Taggart smiled. "They look at the ticker tape of the stock exchange. 
That tells the whole story, doesn't it?" 
"Yes. Yes, it does— in the long run." 

"I must say I'm glad that you haven't been much of a party hound this past 
year. The results show in your work." 
"Do they? Well, no, not quite yet." 

"I suppose, " said Taggart, in the cautious tone of an indirect question, 
"that I should feel flattered you chose to come to this party." 
"Oh, but I had to come. I thought you were expecting me." 
"Why, no, I wasn't . . . that is, I mean—" 

"You should have expected me, James. This is the great, formal, nose- 
counting event, where the victims come in order to show how safe it is to 
destroy them, and the destroyers form pacts of eternal friendship, which 



lasts for three months. I don't know exactly which group I belong to, but I 
had to come and be counted, didn't I?" 

"What in hell do you think you're saying?" Taggart cried furiously, seeing 
the tension on the faces around them. 

"Be careful, James. If you try to pretend that you don't understand me, 
I'm going to make it much clearer." 

"If you think it's proper to utter such—" 

"I think it's funny. There was a time when men were afraid that somebody 
would reveal some secret of theirs that was unknown to their fellows. 
Nowadays, they're afraid that somebody will name what everybody knows. Have 
you practical people ever thought that that's all it would take to blast your 
whole, big, complex structure, with all your laws and guns— just somebody 
naming the exact nature of what you're doing?" 

"If you think it's proper to come to a celebration such as a wedding, in 
order to insult the host—" 

"Why, James, I came here to thank you." 

"To thank me?" 

"Of course. You've done me a great favor— you and your boys in Washington 
and the boys in Santiago. Only I wonder why none of you took the trouble to 
inform me about it. Those directives that somebody issued here a few months 
ago are choking off the entire copper industry of this country. And the 
result is that this country suddenly has to import much larger amounts of 
copper. And where in the world is there any copper left— unless it's d'Anconia 
copper? So you see that I have good reason to be grateful." 

"1 assure you I had nothing to do with it, " Taggart said hastily, "and 
besides, the vital economic policies of this country are not determined by 
any considerations such as you're intimating or — " 

"I know how they're determined, James. I know that the deal started with 
the boys in Santiago, because they've been on the d'Anconia pay roll for 
centuries— well , no, 'pay roll' is an honorable word, it would be more exact 
to say that d'Anconia Copper has been paying them protection money for 
centuries— isn ' t that what your gangsters call it? 

Our boys in Santiago call it taxes. They've been getting their cut on 
every ton of d'Anconia copper sold. So they have a vested interest to see me 
sell as many tons as possible. But with the world turning into People's 
States, this is the only country left where men are not yet reduced to 
digging for roots in forests for their sustenance— so this is the only market 
left on earth. The boys in Santiago wanted to corner this market. I don't 
know what they offered to the boys in Washington, or who traded what and to 
whom— but I know that you came in on it somewhere, because you do hold a 
sizable chunk of d'Anconia Copper stock. And it surely didn't displease you— 
that morning, four months L ago, the day after the directives were issued— to 
see the kind of soaring leap that d'Anconia Copper performed on the Stock 
Exchange. Why, it practically leaped off the ticker tape and into your face." 

"Who gave you any grounds to invent an outrageous story of this kind?" 

"Nobody. I knew nothing about it. I just saw the leap on the ticker tape 
that morning. That told the whole story, didn't it? Besides, the boys in 
Santiago slapped a new tax on copper the following week— and they told me that 
I shouldn't mind it, not with that sudden rise of my stock. They were working 
for my best interests, they said. They said, why should I care— taking the two 
events together, I was richer than I had been before. True enough. I was." 

"Why do you wish to tell me this?" 

"Why don't you wish to take any credit for it, James? That's out of 
character and out of the policy at which you're such an expert. In an age 
when men exist, not by right, but by favor, one does not reject a grateful 
person, one tries to trap into gratitude as many people as possible. Don't 
you want to have me as one of your men under obligation?" 



"I don't know what you're talking about." 

"Think what a favor I received without any effort on my part. I wasn't 
consulted, I wasn't informed, I wasn't thought about, everything was arranged 
without me— and all I have to do now is produce the copper. That was a great 
favor, James— and you may be sure that I will repay it." 

Francisco turned abruptly, not waiting for an answer, and started away. 
Taggart did not follow; he stood, feeling that anything was preferable to one 
more minute of their conversation. 

Francisco stopped when he came to Dagny. He looked at her for a silent 
instant, without greeting, his smile acknowledging that she had been the 
first person he saw and the first one to see him at his entrance into the 
ballroom. 

Against every doubt and warning in her mind, she felt nothing but a joyous 
confidence; inexplicably, she felt as if his figure in that crowd was a point 
of indestructible security. But in the moment when the beginning of a smile 
told him how glad she was to see him, he asked, "Don't you want to tell me 
what a brilliant achievement the John Gait Line turned out to be?" 

She felt her lips trembling and tightening at once, as she answered, ' Tm 
sorry if I show that I'm still open to be hurt. It shouldn't shock me that 
you've come to the stage where you despise achievement." 

"Yes; don't T? I despised that Line so much that I didn't want to see it 
reach the kind of end it has reached." 

He saw her look of sudden attentiveness , the look of thought rushing into 
a breach torn open upon a new direction. He watched her for a moment, as if 
he knew every step she would find along that road, then chuckled and said, 
"Don't you want to ask me now: Who is John Gait?" 

"Why should I want to, and why now?" 

"Don't you remember that you dared him to come and claim your Line? Well, 
he has . " 

He walked on, not waiting to sec the look in her eyes— a look that held 
anger, bewilderment and the first faint gleam of a question mark. 

It was the muscles of his own face that made Rearden realize the nature of 
his reaction to Francisco's arrival: he noticed suddenly that he was smiling 
and that his face had been relaxed into the dim well being of a smile for 
some minutes past, as he watched Francisco d'Anconia in the crowd. 

He acknowledged to himself, for the first time, all the half -grasped, 
half-rejected moments when he had thought of Francisco d'Anconia and thrust 
the thought aside before it became the knowledge of how much he wanted to see 
him again. In moments of sudden exhaustion— 

at his desk, with the fires of the furnaces going down in the twilight— 

in the darkness of the lonely walk through the empty countryside to his 
house— in the silence of sleepless nights— he had found himself thinking of the 
only man who had once seemed to be his spokesman. 

He had pushed the memory aside, telling himself: But that one is worse 
than all the others ! —while feeling certain that this was not true, yet being 
unable to name the reason of his certainty. He had caught himself glancing 
through the newspapers to see whether Francisco d'Anconia had returned to New 
York— and he had thrown the newspapers aside, asking himself angrily: What if 
he did return?— would you go chasing him through night clubs and cocktail 
parties ?— what is it that you want from him? 

This was what he had wanted— he thought, when he caught himself smiling at 
the sight of Francisco in the crowd— this strange feeling of expectation that 
held curiosity, amusement and hope. 

Francisco did not seem to have noticed him. Rearden waited, fighting a 
desire to approach; not after the kind of conversation we had, he thought— 
what for?— what would I say to him? And then, with the same smiling, light- 
hearted feeling, the feeling of being certain that it was right, he found 



himself walking across the ballroom, toward the group that surrounded 
Francisco d'Anconia. 

He wondered, looking at them, why these people were drawn to Francisco, 
why they chose to hold him imprisoned in a clinging circle. 

when their resentment of him was obvious under their smiles. Their faces 
had the hint of a look peculiar, not to fear, but to cowardice: a look of 
guilty anger. Francisco stood cornered against the side edge of a marble 
stairway, half-leaning, half-sitting on the steps; the informality of his 
posture, combined with the strict formality of his clothes, gave him an air 
of superlative elegance. His was the only face that had the carefree look and 
the brilliant smile proper to the enjoyment of a party; but his eyes seemed 
intentionally expressionless, holding no trace of gaiety, showing— like a 
warning signal— nothing but the activity of a heightened perceptiveness . 

Standing unnoticed on the edge of the group, Rearden heard a woman, who 
had large diamond earrings and a flabby, nervous face, ask tensely, "Senior 
d'Anconia, what do you think is going to happen to the world?" 

"Just exactly what it deserves," 

"Oh, how cruel ! " 

"Don't you believe in the operation of the moral law, raadarae?" 
Francisco asked gravely. "I do." 

Rearden heard Bertram Scudder, outside the group, say to a girl who made 
some sound of indignation, "Don't let him disturb you. You know, money is the 
root of all evil— and he's the typical product of money." 

Rearden did not think that Francisco could have heard it, but he saw 
Francisco turning to them with a gravely courteous smile. 

"So you think that money is the root of all evil?" said Francisco 
d'Anconia. "Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of 
exchange, which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men able to 
produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish 
to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money 
is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the 
looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the 
men who produce. 

Is this what you consider evil? 

"When you accept money in payment for your effort, you do so only on the 
conviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others. 
It is not the moochers or the looters who give value to money. Not an ocean 
of tears nor all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in 
your wallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow. Those pieces of 
paper, which should have been gold, are a token of honor— your claim upon the 
energy of the men who produce. Your wallet is your statement of hope that 
somewhere in the world around you there are men who will not default on that 
moral principle which is the root of money. Is this what you consider evil? 

"Have you ever looked for the root of production? Take a look at an 
electric generator and dare tell yourself that it was created by the muscular 
effort of unthinking brutes. Try to grow a seed of wheat without the 
knowledge left to you by men who had to discover it for the first time. Try 
to obtain your food by means of nothing but physical motions— and you'll learn 
that man's mind is the root of all the goods produced and of all the wealth 
that has ever existed on earth. 

"But you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak? 
What strength do you mean? It is not the strength of guns or muscles. Wealth 
is the product of man's capacity to think. Then is money made by the man who 
invents a motor at the expense of those who did not invent it? Is money made 
by the intelligent at the expense of the fools? By the able at the expense of 
the incompetent? By the ambitious at the expense of the lazy? Money is made— 
before it can be looted or mooched— made by the effort of every honest man, 



each to the extent of his ability. An honest man is one who knows that he 
can't consume more than he has produced. 

"To trade by means of money is the code of the men of good will. 

Money rests on the axiom that every man is the owner of his mind and his 
effort. Money allows no power to prescribe the value of your effort except 
the voluntary choice of the man who is willing to trade you his effort in 
return. Money permits you to obtain for your goods and your labor that which 
they are worth to the men who buy them, but no more. Money permits no deals 
except those to mutual benefit by the unforced judgment of the traders. Money 
demands of you the recognition that men must work for their own benefit, not 
for their own injury, for their gain, not their loss— the recognition that 
they are not beasts of burden, born to carry the weight of your misery— that 
you must offer them values, not wounds— that the common bond among men is not 
the exchange of suffering, but the exchange of goods. 

Money demands that you sell, not your weakness to men's stupidity, but 
your talent to their reason; it demands that you buy, not the shoddiest they 
offer, but the best that your money can find. And when men live by trade— with 
reason, not force, as their final arbiter— it is the best product that wins, 
the best performance, the man of best judgment and highest ability— and the 
degree of a man's productiveness is the degree of his reward. This is the 
code of existence whose tool and symbol is money. Is this what you consider 
evil? 

"But money is only a tool. It will take you wherever you wish, but it will 
not replace you as the driver. It will give you the means for the 
satisfaction of your desires, but it will not provide you with desires. 

Money is the scourge of the men who attempt to reverse the law of 
causality— the men who seek to replace the mind by seizing the products of the 
mind . 

"Money will not purchase happiness for the man who has no concept of what 
he wants: money will not give him a code of values, if he's evaded the 
knowledge of what to value, and it will not provide him with a purpose, if 
he's evaded the choke of what to seek. Money will not buy intelligence for 
the fool, or admiration for the coward, or respect for the incompetent. The 
man who attempts to purchase the brains of his superiors to serve him, with 
his money replacing his judgment, ends up by becoming the victim of his 
inferiors. The men of intelligence desert him, but the cheats and the frauds 
come flocking to him, drawn by a law which he has not discovered: that no man 
may be smaller than his money. Is this the reason why you call it evil? 

"Only the man who does not need it, is fit to inherit wealth— the man who 
would make his own fortune no matter where he started. If an heir is equal to 
his money, it serves him; if not, it destroys him. 

But you look on and you cry that money corrupted him. Did it? Or did he 
corrupt his money? Do not envy a worthless heir; his wealth is not yours and 
you would have done no better with it. Do not think that it should have been 
distributed among you; loading the world with fifty parasites instead of one, 
would not bring back the dead virtue which was the fortune. Money is a living 
power that dies without its root. Money will not serve the mind that cannot 
match it. Is this the reason why you call it evil? 

"Money is your means of survival. The verdict you pronounce upon the 
source of your livelihood is the verdict you pronounce upon your life. If the 
source is corrupt, you have damned your own existence. Did you get your money 
by fraud? By pandering to men's vices or men's stupidity? By catering to 
fools, in the hope of getting more than your ability deserves? By lowering 
your standards? By doing work you despise for purchasers you scorn? If so, 
then your money will not give you a moment's or a penny's worth of joy. Then 
all the things you buy will become, not a tribute to you, but a reproach; not 
an achievement, but a reminder of shame. Then you'll scream that money is 



evil. Evil, because it would not pinch-hit for your self-respect? Evil, 
because it would not let you enjoy your depravity? Is this the root of your 
hatred of money? 

"Money will always remain an effect and refuse to replace you as the 
cause. Money is the product of virtue, but it will not give you virtue and it 
will not redeem your vices. Money will not give you the unearned, neither in 
matter nor in spirit. Is this the root of your hatred of money? 

"Or did you say it's the love of money that's the root of all evil? 

To love a thing is to know and love its nature. To love money is to know 
and love the fact that money is the creation of the best power within you, 
and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men. 
It's the person who would sell his soul for a nickel, who is loudest in 
proclaiming his hatred of money— and he has good reason to hate it. The lovers 
of money are willing to work for it. 

They know they are able to deserve it. 

"Let me give you a tip on a clue to men's characters: the man who damns 
money has obtained it dishonorably; the man who respects it has earned it. 

"Run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil. 

That sentence is the leper's bell of an approaching looter. So long as men 
live together on earth and need means to deal with one another— 

their only substitute, if they abandon money, is the muzzle of a gun. 

"But money demands of you the highest virtues, if you wish to make it or 
to keep it. Men who have no courage, pride or self-esteem, men who have no 
moral sense of their right to their money and are not willing to defend it as 
they defend their life, men who apologize for being rich— will not remain rich 
for long. They are the natural bait for the swarms of looters that stay under 
rocks for centuries, but come crawling out at the first smell of a man who 
begs to be forgiven for the guilt of owning wealth. They will hasten to 
relieve him of the guilt— 

and of his life, as he deserves. 

"Then you will see the rise of the men of the double standard— the men who 
live by force, yet count on those who live by trade to create the value of 
their looted money— the men who are the hitchhikers of virtue. In a moral 
society, these are the criminals, and the statutes are written to protect you 
against them. But when a society establishes criminals-by-right and looters- 
by-law— men who use force to seize the wealth of disarmed victims— then money 
becomes its creators' avenger. 

Such looters believe it safe to rob defenseless men, once they've passed a 
law to disarm them. But their loot becomes the magnet for other looters, who 
get it from them as they got it. Then the race goes, not to the ablest at 
production, but to those most ruthless at brutality. When force is the 
standard, the murderer wins over the pickpocket. And then that society 
vanishes, in a spread of ruins and slaughter. 

"Do you wish to know whether that day is coming? Watch money. 

Money is the barometer of a society's virtue. When you see that trading is 
done, not by consent, but by compulsion— when you see that in order to 
produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing— when you 
see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors— when 
you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws 
don't protect you against them, but protect them against you— when you see 
corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice— you may know 
that your society is doomed. Money is so noble a medium that it does not 
compete with guns and it does not make terms with brutality. 

It will not permit a country to survive as half-property, half-loot. 

"Whenever destroyers appear among men, they start by destroying money, for 
money is men's protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyers seize 
gold and leave to its owners a counterfeit pile of paper. This kills all 



objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary 
setter of values. Gold was an objective value, an equivalent of wealth 
produced. Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun 
aimed at those who are expected to "produce it. Paper is a check drawn by 
legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of the 
victims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked: 'Account overdrawn.' 

"When you have made evil the means of survival, do not expect men to 
remain good. Do not expect them to stay moral and lose their lives for the 
purpose of becoming the fodder of the immoral. Do not expect them to produce, 
when production is punished and looting rewarded. Do not ask, 'Who is 
destroying the world?' You are. 

"You stand in the midst of the greatest achievements of the greatest 
productive civilization and you wonder why it's crumbling around you, while 
you're damning its life-blood — money. You look upon money as the savages did 
before you, and you wonder why the jungle is creeping back to the edge of 
your cities. Throughout men's history, money was always seized by looters of 
one brand or another, whose names changed, but whose method remained the 
same: to seize wealth by force and to keep the producers bound, demeaned, 
defamed, deprived of honor. That phrase about the evil of money, which you 
mouth with such righteous recklessness, comes from a time when wealth was 
produced by the labor of slaves— slaves who repeated the motions once 
discovered by somebody's mind and left unimproved for centuries. So long as 
production was ruled by force, and wealth was obtained by conquest, there was 
little to conquer. Yet through all the centuries of stagnation and 
starvation, men exalted the looters, as aristocrats of the sword, as 
aristocrats of birth, as aristocrats of the bureau, and despised the 
producers, as slaves, as traders, as shopkeepers— as industrialists. 

"To the glory of mankind, there was, for the first and only time in 
history, a country of money— and I have no higher, more reverent tribute to 
pay to America, for this means: a country of reason, justice, freedom, 
production, achievement. For the first time, man's mind and money were set 
free, and there were no fortunes-by-conquest, but only fortunes-by-work, and 
instead of swordsmen and slaves, there appeared the real maker of wealth, the 
greatest worker, the highest type of human being— the self-made man— the 
American industrialist. 

"If you ask me to name the proudest distinction of Americans, I would 
choose— because it contains all the others— the fact that they were the people 
who created the phrase 'to make money.' No other language or nation had ever 
used these words before; men had always thought of wealth as a static 
quantity— to be seized, begged, inherited, shared, looted or obtained as a 
favor. Americans were the first to understand that wealth has to be created. 
The words 'to make money' hold the essence of human morality. 

"Yet these were the words for which Americans were denounced by the rotted 
cultures of the looters' continents. Now the looters' credo has brought you 
to regard your proudest achievements as a hallmark of shame, your prosperity 
as guilt, your greatest men, the industrialists, as blackguards, and your 
magnificent factories as the product and property of muscular labor, the 
labor of whip-driven slaves, like the pyramids of Egypt. The rotter who 
simpers that he sees no difference between the power of the dollar and the 
power of the whip, ought to learn the difference on his own hide— as, I think, 
he will. 

"Until and unless you discover that money is the root of all good, you ask 
for your own destruction. When money ceases to be the tool by which men deal 
with one another, then men become the tools of men. Blood, whips and guns— or 
dollars. Take your choice— there is no other— and your time is running out." 

Francisco had not glanced at Rearden once while speaking; but the moment 
he finished, his eyes went straight to Rearden 's face. Rearden stood 



motionless, seeing nothing but Francisco d'Anconia across the moving figures 
and angry voices between them. 

There were people who had listened, but now hurried away, and people who 
said, "It's horrible !"—" It ' s not true!"— "How vicious and self ish ! "—saying it 
loudly and guardedly at once, as if wishing that their neighbors would hear 
them, but hoping that Francisco would not. 

"Senor d'Anconia," declared the woman with the earrings, "I don't agree 
with you ! " 

"If you can refute a single sentence I uttered, madame, I shall hear it 
gratefully . " 

"Oh, I can't answer you. I don't have any answers, my mind doesn't work 
that way, but I don't feel that you're right, so I know that you're wrong." 
"How do you know it?" 

"I feel it. I don't go by my head, but by my heart. You might be good at 
logic, but you're heartless." 

"Madame, when we'll see men dying of starvation around us, your heart 
won't be of any earthly use to save them. And I'm heartless enough to say 
that when you'll scream, 'But I didn't know it! '—you will not be forgiven." 

The woman turned away, a shudder running through the flesh of her cheeks 
and through the angry tremor of her voice: "Well, it's certainly a funny way 
to talk at a party!" 

A portly man with evasive eyes said loudly, his tone of forced 
cheerfulness suggesting that his sole concern in any issue was not to let it 
become unpleasant, "If this is the way you feel about money, senor, I think 
I'm darn glad that I've got a goodly piece of d'Anconia Copper stock." 

Francisco said gravely, "I suggest that you think twice, sir." 

Rearden started toward him— and Francisco, who had not seemed to look in 
his direction, moved to meet him at once, as if the others had never existed 

"Hello, " said Rearden simply, easily, as to a childhood friend; he was 
smiling . 

He saw his own smile reflected in Francisco's face. "Hello." 
"I want to speak to you." 

"To whom do you think I've been speaking for the last quarter of an hour? 

Rearden chuckled, in the manner of acknowledging an opponent's round. "I 
didn't think you had noticed me." 

"I noticed, when I came in, that you were one of the only two persons in 
this room who were glad to see me." 

"Aren't you being presumptuous?" 

"No-grateful . " 

"Who was the other person glad to see you?" 
Francisco shrugged and said lightly, "A woman." 

Rearden noticed that Francisco had led him aside, away from the group, in 
so skillfully natural a manner that neither he nor the others had known it 
was being done intentionally. 

"I didn't expect to find you here," said Francisco. "You shouldn't have 
come to this party." 

"Why not?" 

"May I ask what made you come?" 

"My wife was anxious to accept the invitation." 

"Forgive me if I put it in such form, but it would have been more proper 
and less dangerous if she had asked you to take her on a tour of 
whorehouses . " 

"What danger are you talking about?" 

"Mr. Rearden, you do not know these people's way of doing business or how 
they interpret your presence here. In your code, but not in theirs, acceptin 
a man's hospitality is a token of good will, a declaration that you and your 
host stand on terms of a civilized relationship. 



Don't give them that kind of sanction." 
"Then why did you come here?" 

Francisco shrugged gaily. "Oh, I— it doesn't matter what I do. I'm only a 
party hound." 

"What are you doing at this party?" 
"Just looking for conquests." 
"Found any?" 

His face suddenly earnest, Francisco answered gravely, almost solemnly, 
"Yes— what I think is going to be my best and greatest." 

Rearden's anger was involuntary, the cry, not of reproach, but of despair: 
"How can you waste yourself that way?" 

The faint suggestion of a smile, like the rise of a distant light, came 
into Francisco's eyes as he asked, "Do you care to admit that you care about 
it?" 

"You're going to hear a few more admissions, if that's what you're after. 
Before I met you, I used to wonder how you could waste a fortune such as 
yours. Now it's worse, because I can't despise you as I did, as I'd like to, 
yet the question is much more terrible: How can you waste a mind such as 
yours ? " 

"I don't think I'm wasting it right now." 

"I don't know whether there's ever been anything that meant a damn to you— 
but I'm going to tell you what I've never said to anyone before. When I met 
you, do you remember that you said you wanted to offer me your gratitude?" 

There was no trace of amusement left in Francisco's eyes; Rearden had 
never faced so solemn a look of respect, "Yes, Mr. Rearden," he answered 
quietly . 

"I told you that I didn't need it and I insulted you for it. All right, 
you've won. That speech you made tonight— that was what you were offering me, 
wasn't it?" 

"Yes, Mr. Rearden." 

"It was more than gratitude, and I needed the gratitude; it was more than 
admiration, and I needed that, too; it was much more than any word I can 
find, it will take me days to think of all that it's given me— but one thing I 
do know: I needed it. I've never made an admission of this kind, because I've 
never cried for anyone's help. If it amused you to guess that I was glad to 
see you, you have something real to laugh about now, if you wish." 

"It might take me a few years, but I will prove to you that these are the 
things I do not laugh about." 

"Prove it now— by answering one question: Why don't you practice what you 
preach? " 

"Are you sure that I don't?" 

"If the things you said are true, if you have the greatness to know it, 
you should have been the leading industrialist of the world by now." 

Francisco said gravely, as he had said to the portly man, but with an odd 
note of gentleness in his voice, "I suggest that you think twice, Mr. 
Rearden . " 

"I've thought about you more than I care to admit. I have found no 
answer . " 

"Let me give you a hint: If the things I said are true, who is the 
guiltiest man in this room tonight?" 
"I suppose— James Taggart?" 

"No, Mr. Rearden, it is not James Taggart. But you must define the guilt 
and choose the man yourself." 

"A few years ago, I would have said that it's you. I still think that 
that's what I ought to say. But I'm almost in the position of that fool woman 
who spoke to you: every reason I know tells me that you're guilty— and yet I 
can't feel it." 



"You are making the same mistake as that woman, Mr. Rearden, though in a 
nobler form. " 

"What do you mean?" 

"I mean much more than just your judgment of me. That woman and all those 
like her keep evading the thoughts which they know to be good. You keep 
pushing out of your mind the thoughts which you believe to be evil. They do 
it, because they want to avoid effort. You do it, because you won't permit 
yourself to consider anything that would spare y6u. They indulge their 
emotions at any cost. You sacrifice your emotions as the first cost of any 
problem. They are willing to bear nothing. You are willing to bear anything. 
They keep evading responsibility. You keep assuming it. But don't you see 
that the essential error is the same? Any refusal to recognize reality, for 
any reason whatever, has disastrous consequences. There are no evil thoughts 
except one: the refusal to think. Don't ignore your own desires, Mr. 

Rearden. Don't sacrifice them. Examine their cause. There is a limit to 
how much you should have to bear." 

"How did you know this about me?" 

"I made the same mistake, once. But not for long." 

"I wish—" Rearden began and stopped abruptly. 

Francisco smiled. "Afraid to wish, Mr. Rearden?" 

"I wish I could permit myself to like you as much as I do." 

"I'd give—" Francisco stopped; inexplicably, Rearden saw the look of an 
emotion which he could not define, yet felt certain to be pain; he saw 
Francisco's first moment of hesitation. "Mr. Rearden, do you own any 
d'Anconia Copper stock?" 

Rearden looked at him, bewildered. "No." 

"Some day, you'll know what treason I'm committing right now, but . . . 
Don't ever buy any d'Anconia Copper stock. Don't ever deal with d'Anconia 
Copper in any way." 

"Why?" 

"When you'll learn the full reason, you'll know whether there's ever been 
anything— or anyone— that meant a damn to me, and . . . and how much he did 
mean . " 

Rearden frowned: he had remembered something. "I wouldn't deal with your 
company. Didn't you call them the men of the double standard? Aren't you one 
of the looters who is growing rich right now by means of directives?" 

Inexplicably, the words did not hit Francisco as an insult, but cleared 
his face back into his look of assurance. "Did you think that it was I who 
wheedled those directives out of the robber-planners?" 

"If not, then who did it?" 

"My hitchhikers." 

"Without your consent?" 

"Without my knowledge." 

"I'd hate to admit how much I want to believe you— but there's no way for 
you to prove it now." 

"No? I'll prove it to you within the next fifteen minutes." 

"How? The fact remains that you've profited the most from those 
directives . " 

"That's true. I've profited more than Mr. Mouch and his gang could ever 
imagine. After my years of work, they gave me just the chance I needed." 
"Are you boasting?" 

"You bet I am!" Rearden saw incredulously that Francisco's eyes had a 
hard, bright look, the look, not of a party hound, but of a man of action. 
"Mr. Rearden, do you know where most of those new aristocrats keep their 
hidden money? Do you know where most of the fair share vultures have invested 
their profits from Rearden Metal?" 

"No, but-" 



"In d'Anconia Copper stock. Safely out of the way and out of the country. 
D'Anconia Copper— an old, invulnerable company, so rich that it would last for 
three more generations of looting. A company managed by a decadent playboy 
who doesn't give a damn, who'll let them use his property in any way they 
please and just continue to make money for them— automatically, as did his 
ancestors. Wasn't that a perfect setup for the looters, Mr. Rearden? Only— 
what one single point did they miss?" 

Rearden was staring at him. "What are you driving at?" 

Francisco laughed suddenly. "It's too bad about those profiteers on 
Rearden Metal. You wouldn't want them to lose the money you made for them, 
would you, Mr. Rearden? But accidents do happen in the world— you know what 
they say, man is only a helpless plaything at the mercy of nature's 
disasters. For instance, there was a fire at the d'Anconia ore docks in 
Valparaiso tomorrow morning, a fire that razed them to the ground along with 
half of the port structures. What time is it, Mr. Rearden? Oh, did I mix my 
tenses? Tomorrow afternoon, there will be a rock slide in the d'Anconia mines 
at Orano— no lives lost, no casualties, except the mines themselves. It will 
be found that the mines are done for, because they had been worked in the 
wrong places for months— what can you expect from a playboy's management? The 
great deposits of copper will be buried under tons of mountain where a 
Sebastian d'Anconia would not be able to reclaim them in less than three 
years, and a People's State will never reclaim them at all. When the 
stockholders begin to look into things, they will find that the mines at 
Campos, at San Felix, at Las Heras have been worked in exactly the same 
manner and have been running at a loss for over a year, only the playboy 
juggled the books and kept it out of the newspapers. 

Shall I tell you what they will discover about the management of the 
d'Anconia foundries? Or of the d'Anconia ore fleet? But all these discoveries 
won't do the stockholders any good anyway, because the stock of d'Anconia 
Copper will have crashed tomorrow morning, crashed like an electric bulb 
against concrete, crashed like an express elevator, spattering pieces of 
hitchhikers all over the gutters!" 

The triumphant rise of Francisco's voice merged with a matching sound: 
Rearden burst out laughing. 

Rearden did not know how long that moment lasted or what he had felt, it 
had been like a blow hurling him into another kind of consciousness, then a 
second blow returning him to his own— all that was left, as at the awakening 
from a narcotic, was the feeling that he had known some immense kind of 
freedom, never to be matched in reality. This was like the Wyatt fire again, 
he thought, this was his secret danger. 

He found himself backing away from Francisco d'Anconia, Francisco stood 
watching him intently, and looked as if he had been watching him all through 
that unknown length of time. 

"There are no evil thoughts, Mr. Rearden," Francisco said softly, "except 
one: the refusal to think." 

"No, " said Rearden; it was almost a whisper, he had to keep his voice 
down, he was afraid that he would hear himself scream it, "no ... if this 
is the key to you, no, don't expect me to cheer you . . . 

you didn't have the strength to fight them . . . you chose the easiest, 
most vicious way . . . deliberate destruction . . . the destruction of an 
achievement you hadn't produced and couldn't match. . . . " 

'That's not what you'll read in the newspapers tomorrow. There won't be 
any evidence of deliberate destruction. Everything happened in the normal, 
explicable, justifiable course of plain incompetence. Incompetence isn't 
supposed to be punished nowadays, is it? The boys in Buenos Aires and the 
boys in Santiago will probably want to hand me a subsidy, by way of 
consolation and reward. There's still a great part of the d'Anconia Copper 



Company left, though a great part of it is gone for good. Nobody will say 
that I've done it intentionally. You may think what you wish." 

"I think you're the guiltiest man in this room," said Rearden quietly, 
wearily; even the fire of his anger was gone; he felt nothing but the 
emptiness left by the death of a great hope. "I think you're worse than 
anything I had supposed. ..." 

Francisco looked at him with a strange half-smile of serenity, the 
serenity of a victory over pain, and did not answer. 

It was their silence that let them hear the voices of the two men who 
stood a few steps away, and they turned to look at the speakers. 

The stocky, elderly man was obviously a businessman of the conscientious, 
unspectacular kind. His formal dress suit was of good quality, but of a cut 
fashionable twenty years before, with the faintest tinge of green at the 
seams; he had had few occasions to wear it. His shirt studs were 
ostentatiously too large, but it was the pathetic ostentation of an heirloom, 
intricate pieces of old-fashioned workmanship, that had probably come to him 
through four generations, like his business. 

His face had the expression which, these days, was the mark of an honest 
man: an expression of bewilderment. He was looking at his companion, trying 
hard— conscientiously, helplessly, hopelessly— to understand. 

His companion was younger and shorter, a small man with lumpy flesh, with 
a chest thrust forward and the thin points of a mustache thrust up. He was 
saying, in a tone of patronizing boredom, "Well, I don't know. All of you are 
crying about rising costs, it seems to be the stock complaint nowadays, it's 
the usual whine of people whose profits are squeezed a little. I don't know, 
we'll have to see, we'll have to decide whether we'll permit you to make any 
profits or not." 

Rearden glanced at Francisco— and saw a face that went beyond his 
conception of what the purity of a single purpose could do to a human 
countenance: it was the most merciless face one could ever be permitted to 
see. He had thought of himself as ruthless, but he knew that he could not 
match this level, naked, implacable look, dead to all feeling but justice. 
Whatever the rest of him— thought Rearden— the man who could experience this 
was a giant. 

It was only a moment. Francisco turned to him, his face normal, and said 
very quietly, "I've changed my mind, Mr. Rearden. I'm glad that you came to 
this party. I want you to see this." 

Then, raising his voice, Francisco said suddenly, in the gay, loose, 
piercing tone of a man of complete irresponsibility, "You won't grant me that 
loan, Mr. Rearden? It puts me on a terrible spot. I must get the money— I must 
raise it tonight— I must raise it before the Stock Exchange opens in the 
morning, because otherwise—" 

He did not have to continue, because the little man with the mustache was 
clutching at his arm. 

Rearden had never believed that a human body could change dimensions 
within one's sight, but he saw the man shrinking in weight, in posture, in 
form, as if the air were let out of his lumps, and what had been an arrogant 
ruler was suddenly a piece of scrap that could not be a threat to anyone. 

"Is ... is there something wrong, Senor d'Anconia? I mean, on ... on 
the Stock Exchange?" 

Francisco jerked his finger to his lips, with a frightened glance. 

"Keep quiet," he whispered. "For God's sake, keep quiet!" 

The man was shaking. "Something's . . . wrong?" 

"You don't happen to own any d'Anconia Copper stock, do you?" 

The man nodded, unable to speak. "Oh my, that's too bad! Well, listen, 
I'll tell you, if you give me your word of honor that you won't repeat it to 
anyone, You don't want to start a panic." 



"Word of honor . . . " gasped the man. 

"What you'd better do is run to your stockbroker and sell as fast as you 
can— because things haven't been going too well for d'Anconia Copper, I'm 
trying to raise some money, but if I don't succeed, you'll be lucky if you'll 
have ten cents on your dollar tomorrow morning— 

oh my! I forgot that you can't reach your stockbroker before tomorrow 
morning— well , it's too bad, but—" 

The man was running across the room, pushing people out of his way, like a 
torpedo shot into the crowd. 

"Watch," said Francisco austerely, turning to Rearden. 

The man was lost in the crowd, they could not see him, they could not tell 
to whom he was selling his secret or whether he had enough of his cunning 
left to make it a trade with those who held favors— but they saw the wake of 
his passage spreading through the room, the sudden cuts splitting the crowd, 
like the first few cracks, then like the accelerating branching that runs 
through a wall about to crumble, the streaks of emptiness slashed, not by a 
human touch, but by the impersonal breath of terror. 

There were the voices abruptly choked off, the pools of silence, then 
sounds of a different nature; the rising, hysterical inflections of uselessly 
repeated questions, the unnatural whispers, a woman's scream, the few spaced, 
forced giggles of those still trying to pretend that nothing was happening. 

There were spots of immobility in the motion of the crowd, like spreading 
blotches of paralysis; there was a sudden stillness, as if a motor had been 
cut off; then came the frantic, jerking, purposeless, rudderless movement of 
objects bumping down a hill by the blind mercy of gravitation and of every 
rock they hit on the way. People were running out, running to telephones, 
running to one another, clutching or pushing the bodies around them at 
random. These men, the most powerful men in the country, those who held, 
unanswerable to any power, the power over every man's food and every man's 
enjoyment of his span of years on earth— these men had become a pile of 
rubble, clattering in the wind of panic, the rubble left of a structure when 
its key pillar has been cut. 

James Taggart, his face indecent in its exposure of emotions which 
centuries had taught men to keep hidden, rushed up to Francisco and screamed, 
"Is it true?" 

"Why, James," said Francisco, smiling, "what's the matter? Why do you seem 
to be upset? Money is the root of all evil— so I just got tired of being 
evil." 

Taggart ran toward the main exit, yelling something to Orren Boyle on the 
way. Boyle nodded and kept on nodding, with the eagerness and humility of an 
inefficient servant, then darted of in another direction. Cherryl, her 
wedding veil coiling like a crystal cloud upon the air, as she ran after him, 
caught Taggart at the door. "Jim, what's the matter?" He pushed her aside and 
she fell against the stomach of Paul Larkin, as Taggart rushed out. 

Three persons stood immovably still, like three pillars spaced through the 
room, the lines of their sight cutting across the spread of the wreckage: 
Dagny, looking at Francisco— Francisco and Rearden, looking at each other. 



CHAPTER III 
WHITE BLACKMAIL 



"What time is it?" 

It's running out, thought Rearden— but he answered, "I don't know, Not yet 
midnight," and remembering his wrist watch, added, "Twenty of." 
"I'm going to take a train home," said Lillian. 

He heard the sentence, but it had to wait its turn to enter the crowded 
passages to his consciousness. He stood looking absently at the living room 
of his suite, a few minutes' elevator ride away from the party. In a moment, 
he answered automatically, "At this hour?" 

"It's still early. There are plenty of trains running." 

"You're welcome to stay here, of course." 

"No, I think I prefer to go home." He did not argue. "What about you, 
Henry? Do you intend going home tonight?" 

"No." He added, "I have business appointments here tomorrow." 
"As you wish." 

She shrugged her evening wrap off her shoulders, caught it on her arm and 
started toward the door of his bedroom, but stopped. 

"I hate Francisco d'Anconia," she said tensely. "Why did he have to come 
to that party? And didn't he know enough to keep his mouth shut, at least 
till tomorrow morning?" He did not answer. "It's monstrous— what he's allowed 
to happen to his company. Of course, he's nothing but a rotten playboy— still , 
a fortune of that size is a responsibility, there's a limit to the negligence 
a man can permit himself!" He glanced at her face: it was oddly tense, the 
features sharpened, making her look older. "He owed a certain duty to his 
stockholders, didn't he? 

. . . Didn't he, Henry?" 

"Do you mind if we don't discuss it?" 

She made a tightening, sidewise movement with her lips, the equivalent of 
a shrug, and walked into the bedroom. 

He stood at the window, looking down at the streaming roofs of 
automobiles, letting his eyes rest on something while his faculty of sight 
was disconnected. His mind was still focused on the crowd in the ballroom 
downstairs and on two figures in that crowd. But as his living room remained 
on the edge of his vision, so the sense of some action he had to perform 
remained on the edge of his consciousness. He grasped it for a moment— it was 
the fact that he had to remove his evening clothes— 

but farther beyond the edge there was the feeling of reluctance to undress 
in the presence of a strange woman in his bedroom, and he forgot it again in 
the next moment . 

Lillian came out, as trimly groomed as she had arrived, the beige 
traveling suit outlining her figure with efficient tightness, the hat tilted 
over half a head of hair set in waves. She carried her suitcase, swinging it 
a little, as if in demonstration of her ability to carry it. 

He reached over mechanically and took the suitcase out of her hand. 

"What are you doing?" she asked. 

"I'm going to take you to the station." 

"Like this? You haven't changed your clothes." 

"It doesn't matter." 

"You don't have to escort me. I'm quite able to find my own way. If you 
have business appointments tomorrow, you'd better go to bed." 

He did not answer, but walked to the door, held it open for her and 
followed her to the elevator. 

They remained silent when they rode in a taxicab to the station. At such 
moments as he remembered her presence, he noticed that she sat efficiently 



straight, almost flaunting the perfection of her poise; she seemed alertly 
awake and contented, as if she were starting out on a purposeful journey of 
early morning. 

The cab stopped at the entrance to the Taggart Terminal. The bright lights 
flooding the great glass doorway transformed the lateness of the hour into a 
sense of active, timeless security. Lillian jumped lightly out of the cab, 
saying, "No, no, you don't have to get out, drive on back. 

Will you be home for dinner tomorrow— or next month?" 

"I'll telephone you," he said. 

She waved her gloved hand at him and disappeared into the lights of the 
entrance. As the cab started forward, he gave the driver the address of 
Dagny's apartment. 

The apartment was dark when he entered, but the door to her bedroom was 
half-open and he heard her voice saying, "Hello, Hank." 
He walked in, asking, "Were you asleep?" 
"No. " 

He switched on the light. She lay in bed, her head propped by the pillow, 
her hair falling smoothly to her shoulders, as if she had not moved for a 
long time; but her face was untroubled. She looked like a schoolgirl, with 
the tailored collar of a pale blue nightgown lying severely high at the base 
of her throat; the nightgown's front was a deliberate contrast to the 
severity, a spread of pale blue embroidery that looked luxuriously adult and 
feminine . 

He sat down on the edge of the bed— and she smiled, noticing that the stern 
formality of his full dress clothes made his action so simply, naturally 
intimate. He smiled in answer. He had come, prepared to reject the 
forgiveness she had granted him at the party, as one rejects a favor from too 
generous an adversary. Instead, he reached out suddenly and moved his hand 
over her forehead, down the line of her hair, in a gesture of protective 
tenderness, in the sudden feeling of how delicately childlike she was, this 
adversary who had borne the constant challenge of his strength, but who 
should have had his protection. 

"You're carrying BO much," he said, "and it's I who make it harder for you 

"No, Hank, you don't and you know it." 

"I know that you have the strength not to let it hurt you, but it's a 
strength I have no right to call upon. Yet I do, and I have no solution, no 
atonement to offer. I can only admit that I know it and that there's no way I 
can ask you to forgive me." 

"There's nothing to forgive." 

"I had no right to bring her into your presence." 

"It did not hurt me. Only . . ." 

"Yes?" 

". . . only seeing the way you suffered . . . was hard to see." 

"I don't think that suffering makes up for anything, but whatever I felt, 
I didn't suffer enough, if there's one thing I loathe, it's to speak of my 
own suffering— that should be no one's concern but mine. But if you want to 
know, since you know it already— yes, it was hell for me. And I wish it were 
worse. At least, I'm not letting myself get away with it." 

He said it sternly, without emotion, as an impersonal verdict upon 
himself. She smiled, in amused sadness, she took his hand and pressed it to 
her lips, and shook her head in rejection of the verdict, holding her face 
hidden against his hand. 

"What do you mean?" he asked softly. 

"Nothing . . ." Then she raised her head and said firmly, "Hank, I knew 
you were married. I knew what I was doing. I chose to do it. 

There's nothing that you owe me, no duty that you have to consider." 



He shook his head slowly, in protest. 

"Hank, I want nothing from you except what you wish to give me. 

Do you remember that you called me a trader once? I want you to come to me 
seeking nothing but your own enjoyment. So long as you wish to remain 
married, whatever your reason, I have no right to resent it. My way of 
trading is to know that the joy you give me is paid for by the joy you get 
from me— not by your suffering or mine. I don't accept sacrifices and I don't 
make them. If you asked me for more than you meant to me, I would refuse. If 
you asked me to give up the railroad, I'd leave you. If ever the pleasure of 
one has to be bought by the pain of the other, there better be no trade at 
all. A trade by which one gains and the other loses is a fraud. You don't do 
it in business, Hank. 

Don't do it in your own life." 

Like a dim sound track under her words, he was hearing the words said to 
him by Lillian; he was seeing the distance between the two, the difference in 
what they sought from him and from life. 

"Dagny, what do you think of my marriage?" 

"I have no right to think of it." 

"You must have wondered about it." 

"I did . . . before I came to Ellis Wyatt ' s house. Not since." 
"You've never asked me a question about it." 
"And won ' t . " 

He was silent for a moment, then said, looking straight at her, 
underscoring his first rejection of the privacy she had always granted him, 
"There's one thing I want you to know: I have not touched her since . . . 
Ellis Wyatt ' s house." 

"I'm glad. " 

"Did you think I could?" 

"I've never permitted myself to wonder about that." 

"Dagny, do you mean that if I had, you . . . you'd accept that, too?" 
"Yes . " 

"You wouldn't hate it?" 

"I'd hate it more than I can tell you. But if that were your choice, I 
would accept it. I want you, Hank." 

He took her hand and raised it to his lips, she felt the moment's struggle 
in his body, in the sudden movement with which he came down, half -collapsing, 
and let his mouth cling to her shoulder. Then he pulled her forward, he 
pulled the length of her body in the pale blue nightgown to lie stretched 
across his knees, he held it with an unsmiling violence, as if in hatred for 
her words and as if they were the words he had most wanted to hear. 

He bent his face down to hers and she heard the question that had come 
again and again in the nights of the year behind them, always torn out of him 
involuntarily, always as a sudden break that betrayed his constant, secret 
torture: "Who was your first man?" 

She strained back, trying to draw away from him, but he held her. 

"No, Hank," she said, her face hard. 

The brief, taut movement of his lips was a smile. "I know that you won't 
answer it, but I won't stop asking— because that is what I'll never accept." 
"Ask yourself why you won't accept it." 

He answered, his hand moving slowly from her breasts to her knees, as if 
stressing his ownership and hating it, "Because . . . the things you've 
permitted me to do . . .1 didn't think you could, not ever, not even for me 
. . . but to find that you did, and more: that you had permitted another man, 
had wanted him to, had—" 

"Do you understand what you're saying? That you've never accepted my 
wanting you, either— you ' ve never accepted that I should want you, just as I 
should have wanted him, once." 



He said, his voice low, "That's true." 

She tore herself away from him with a brusque, twisting movement, she 
stood up, but she stood looking down at him with a faint smile, and she said 
softly, "Do you know your only real guilt? With the greatest capacity for it, 
you've never learned to enjoy yourself. You've always rejected your own 
pleasure too easily. You've been willing to bear too much." 

"He said that, too." 

"Who?" 

"Francisco d'Anconia." 

He wondered why he had the impression that the name shocked her and that 
she answered an instant too late, "He said that to you?" 
"We were talking about quite a different subject." 

In a moment, she said calmly, "I saw you talking to him. Which one of you 
was insulting the other, this time?" 

"We weren't. Dagny, what do you think of him?" 

"I think that he's done it intentionally— that smash-up we're in for, 
tomorrow . " 

"I know he has. Still, what do you think of him as a person?" 
"I don't know. I ought to think that he's the most depraved person I've 
ever met . " 

"You ought to? But you don't?" 

"No. I can't quite make myself feel certain of it." 

He smiled. "That's what's strange about him. I know that he's a liar, a 
loafer, a cheap playboy, the most viciously irresponsible waste of a human 
being I ever imagined possible. Yet, when I look at him, I feel that if ever 
there was a man to whom I would entrust my life, he's the one." 

She gasped. "Hank, are you saying that you like him?" 

"I'm saying that I didn't know what it meant, to like a man, I didn't know 
how much I missed it— until I met him, " 

"Good God, Hank, you've fallen for him!" 

"Yes— I think I have." He smiled. "Why does it frighten you?" 

"Because . . . because I think he's going to hurt you in some terrible way 
. . . and the more you see in him, the harder it will be to bear . . . and it 
will take you a long time to get over it, if ever. . . . 

I feel that I ought to warn you against him, but I can ' t— because I'm 
certain of nothing about him, not even whether he's the greatest or the 
lowest man on earth." 

"I'm certain of nothing about him— except that I like him." 

"But think of what' he's done. It's not Jim and Boyle that he's hurt, it's 
you and me and Ken Danagger and the rest of us, because Jim's gang will 
merely take it out on us— and it's going to be another disaster, like the 
Wyatt fire." 

"Yes . . . yes, like the Wyatt fire. But, you know, I don't think I care 
too much about that. What's one more disaster? Everything's going anyway, 
it's only a question of a little faster or a little slower, all that's left 
for us ahead is to keep the ship afloat as long as we can and then go down 
with it." 

"Is that his excuse for himself? Is that what he's made you feel?" 
"No. Oh no! That's the feeling I lose when I speak to him. The strange 
thing is what he does make me feel." 
"What?" 
"Hope. " 

She nodded, in helpless wonder, knowing that she had felt it, too. 

"I don't know why," he said. "But I look at people and they seem to be 
made of nothing but pain. He's not. You're not. That terrible hopelessness 
that's all around us, I lose it only in his presence. And here. 

Nowhere else." 



She came back to him and slipped down to sit at his feet, pressing her 
face to his knees. "Hank, we still have so much ahead of us . . . 
and so much right now. ..." 

He looked at the shape of pale blue silk huddled against the black of his 
clothes— he bent down to her— he said, his voice low, "Dagny . . . 

the things I said to you that morning in Ellis Wyatt ' s house ... I think 
I was lying to myself." 

"I know it." 

Through a gray drizzle of rain, the calendar above the roofs said: 
September 3, and a clock on another tower said: 10:40, as Rearden rode back 
to the Wayne-Falkland Hotel. The cab's radio was spitting out shrilly the 
sounds of a panic-tinged voice announcing the crash of d'Anconia Copper. 

Rearden leaned wearily against the seat: the disaster seemed to be no more 
than a stale news story read long ago. He felt nothing, except an 
uncomfortable sense of impropriety at finding himself out in the morning 
streets, dressed in evening clothes. He felt no desire to return from the 
world he had left to the world he saw drizzling past the windows of the taxi. 

He turned the key in the door of his hotel suite, hoping to get back to a 
desk as fast as possible and have to see nothing around him. 

They hit his consciousness together: the breakfast table— the door to his 
bedroom., open upon the sight of a bed that had been slept in— and Lillian's 
voice saying, "Good morning, Henry." 

She sat in an armchair, wearing the suit she had worn yesterday, without 
the jacket or hat; her white blouse looked smugly crisp. There were remnants 
of a breakfast on the table. She was smoking a cigarette, with the air and 
pose of a long, patient vigil. 

As he stood still, she took the time to cross her legs and settle down 
more comfortably, then asked, "Aren't you going to say anything, Henry?" 

He stood like a man in military uniform at some official proceedings where 
emotions could not be permitted to exist. "It is for you to speak." 

"Aren't you going to try to justify yourself?" 

"No . " 

"Aren't you going to start begging my forgiveness?" 

"There is no reason why you should forgive me. There is nothing for me to 
add. You know the truth. Now it is up to you." 

She chuckled, stretching, rubbing her shoulder blades against the chair's 
back. "Didn't you expect to be caught, sooner or later?" she asked. "If a man 
like you stays pure as a monk for over a year, didn't you think that I might 
begin to suspect the reason? It's funny, though, that that famous brain of 
yours didn't prevent you from getting caught as simply as this." She waved at 
the room, at the breakfast table. "I felt certain that you weren't going to 
return here, last night. And it wasn't difficult or expensive at all to find 
out from a hotel employee, this morning, that you haven't spent a night in 
these rooms in the past year." 

He said nothing. 

"The man of stainless steel!" She laughed. "The man of achievement and 
honor who's so much better than the rest of us! Does she dance in the chorus 
or is she a manicurist in an exclusive barber shop patronized by 
millionaires ? " 

He remained silent. 

"Who is she, Henry?" 

"I won't answer that." 

"I want to know." 

"You're not going to." 

"Don't you think it's ridiculous, your playing the part of a gentleman 
who's protecting the lady's name— or of any sort of gentleman, from now on? 
Who is she?" 



"I said I won't answer." 

She shrugged. "I suppose it makes no difference. There's only one standard 
type for the one standard purpose. I've always known that under that ascetic 
look of yours you were a plain, crude sensualist who sought nothing from a 
woman except an animal satisfaction which I pride myself on not having given 
you. I knew that your vaunted sense of honor would collapse some day and you 
would be drawn to the lowest, cheapest type of female, just like any other 
cheating husband." 

She chuckled. "That great admirer of yours, Miss Dagny Taggart, was 
furious at me for the mere hint of a suggestion that her hero wasn't as pure 
as his stainless, non-corrosive rail. And she was naive enough to imagine 
that I could suspect her of being the type men find attractive for a 
relationship in which what they seek is most notoriously not brains. I knew 
your real nature and inclinations. Didn't I?" He said nothing. "Do you know 
what [ think of you now?" 

"You have the right to condemn me in any way you wish." 

She laughed. "The great man who was so contemptuous— in business— of 
weaklings who trimmed corners or fell by the wayside, because they couldn't 
match his strength of character and steadfastness of purpose! How do you feel 
about it now?" 

"My feelings need not concern you. You have the right to decide what you 
wish me to do. I will agree to any demand you make, except one: don't ask me 
to give it up." 

"Oh, I wouldn't ask you to give it up! I wouldn't expect you to change 
your nature. This is your true level— under all that self-made grandeur of a 
knight of industry who rose by sheer genius from the ore mine gutters to 
finger bowls and white tie! It fits you welt, that white tie, to come home in 
at eleven o'clock in the morning! You never rose out of the ore mines, that's 
where you belong— all of you self-made princes of the cash register— in the 
corner saloon on Saturday night, with the traveling salesmen and the dance- 
hall girls!" 

"Do you wish to divorce me?" 

"Oh, wouldn't you like that! Wouldn't that be a smart trade to pull! 
Don't you suppose I know that you've wanted to divorce me since the first 
month of our marriage?" 

"If that is what you thought, why did you stay with me?" 

She answered severely, "It's a question you have lost the right to ask." 

"That's true," he said, thinking that only one conceivable reason, her 
love for him, could justify her answer. 

"No, I'm not going to divorce you. Do you suppose that I will allow your 
romance with a floozie to deprive me of my home, my name, my social position? 
I shall preserve such pieces of my life as I can, whatever does not rest on 
so shoddy a foundation as your fidelity. Make no mistake about it: I shall 
never give you a divorce. Whether you like it or not, you're married and 
you'll stay married." 

"I will, if that is what you wish." 

"And furthermore, I will not consider— incidentally, why don't you sit 
down?" 

He remained standing. "Please say what you have to say." 

"I will not consider any unofficial divorce, such as a separation. You may 
continue your love idyll in the subways and basements where it belongs, but 
in the eyes of the world I will expect you to remember that I am Mrs. Henry 
Rearden. You have always proclaimed such an exaggerated devotion to honesty— 
now let me see you be condemned to the life of the hypocrite that you really 
are. I will expect you to maintain your residence at the home which is 
officially yours, but will now be mine." 

"If you wish." 



She leaned back loosely, in a manner of untidy relaxation, her legs spread 
apart, her arms resting in two strict parallels on the arms of the chair— like 
a judge who could permit himself to be sloppy. 

"Divorce?" she said, chuckling coldly. "Did you think you'd get off as 
easily as that? Did you think you'd get by at the price of a few of your 
millions tossed off as alimony? You're so used to purchasing whatever you 
wish by the simple means of your dollars, that you cannot conceive of things 
that are non-commercial, non-negotiable, non-subject to any kind of trade. 
You're unable to believe that there may exist a person who feels no concern 
for money. You cannot imagine what that means. 

Well, I think you're going to learn. Oh yes, of course you'll agree to any 
demand I make, from now on. I want you to sit in that office of which you're 
so proud, in those precious mills of yours, and play the hero who works 
eighteen hours a day, the giant of industry who keeps the whole country 
going, the genius who is above the common herd of whining, lying, chiseling 
humanity. Then I want you to come home and face the only person who knows you 
for what you really are, who knows the actual value of your word, of your 
honor, of your integrity, of your vaunted self-esteem. I want you to face, in 
your own home, the one person who despises you and has the right to do so. I 
want you to look at me whenever you build another furnace, or pour another 
record breaking load of steel, or hear applause and admiration, whenever you 
feel proud of yourself, whenever you feel clean, whenever you feel drunk on 
the sense of your own greatness. I want you to look at me whenever you hear 
of some act of depravity, or feel anger at human corruption, or feel contempt 
for someone's knavery, or are the victim of a new governmental extortion— to 
look and to know that you're no better, that you're superior to no one, that 
there's nothing you have the right to condemn. I want you to look at me and 
to learn the fate of the man who tried to build a tower to the sky, or the 
man who wanted to reach the sun on wings made of wax— or you, the man who 
wanted to hold himself as perfect!" 

Somewhere outside of him and apart, as if he were reading it in a brain 
not his own, he observed the thought that there was some flaw in the scheme 
of the punishment she wanted him to bear, something wrong by its own terms, 
aside from its propriety or justice, some practical miscalculation that would 
demolish it all if discovered. He did not attempt to discover it. The thought 
went by as a moment's notation, made in cold curiosity, to be brought back in 
some distant future. There was nothing within him now with which to feel 
interest or to respond. 

His own brain was numb with the effort to hold the last of his sense of 
justice against so overwhelming a tide of revulsion that it swamped Lillian 
out of human form, past all his pleas to himself that he had no right to feel 
it. If she was loathsome, he thought, it was he who had brought her to it; 
this was her way of taking pain— no one could prescribe the form of a human 
being's attempt to bear suffering— no one could blame— above all, not he, who 
had caused it. But he saw no evidence of pain in her manner. Then perhaps the 
ugliness was the only means she could summon to hide it, he thought. Then he 
thought of nothing except of withstanding the revulsion, for the length of 
the next moment and of the next. 

When she stopped speaking, he asked, "Have you finished?" 

"Yes, I believe so." 

"Then you had better take the train home now." 

When he undertook the motions necessary to remove his evening clothes, he 
discovered that his muscles felt as if he were at the end of a long day of 
physical labor. His starched shirt was limp with sweat. 

There was neither thought nor feeling left in him, nothing but a sense 
that merged the remnants of both, the sense of congratulation upon the 



greatest victory he had ever demanded of himself: that Lillian had walked out 
of the hotel suite alive. 

Entering Rearden's office, Dr. Floyd Ferris wore the expression of a man 
so certain of the success of his quest that he could afford a benevolent 
smile. He spoke with a smooth, cheerful assurance; Rearden had the impression 
that it was the assurance of a cardsharp who has spent a prodigious effort in 
memorizing every possible variation of the pattern, and is now safe in the 
knowledge that every card in the deck is marked. 

"Well, Mr. Rearden," he said, by way of greeting, "I didn't know that even 
a hardened hound of public functions and shaker of famous hands, like myself, 
could still get a thrill out of meeting an eminent man, but that's what I 
feel right now, believe it or not." 

"How do you do," said Rearden. 

Dr. Ferris sat down and made a few remarks about the colors of the leaves 
in the month of October, as he had observed them by the roadside on his long 
drive from Washington, undertaken specifically for the purpose of meeting Mr. 
Rearden in person. Rearden said nothing. Dr. 

Ferris looked out the window and commented on the inspiring sight of the 
Rearden mills which, he said, were one of the most valuable productive 
enterprises in the country. 

"That is not what you thought of my product a year and a half ago, " 

said Rearden. 

Dr. Ferris gave a brief frown, as if a dot of the pattern had slipped and 
almost cost him the game, then chuckled, as if he had recaptured it. "That 
was a year and a half ago, Mr. Rearden," he said easily. 

"Times change, and people change with the times— the wise ones do. 

Wisdom lies in knowing when to remember and when to forget. Consistency is 
not a habit of mind which it is wise to practice or to expect of the human 
race . " 

He then proceeded to discourse upon the foolishness of consistency in a 
world where nothing was absolute except the principle of compromise. He 
talked earnestly, but in a casual manner, as if they both understood that 
this was not the main subject of their interview; yet, oddly, he spoke not in 
the tone of a foreword, but in the tone of a postscript, as if the main 
subject had been settled long ago. 

Rearden waited for the first "Don't you think so?" and answered, "Please 
state the urgent matter for which you requested this appointment." 

Dr. Ferris looked astonished and blank for a moment, then said brightly, 
as if remembering an unimportant subject which could be disposed of without 
effort, "Oh, that? That was in regard to the dates of delivery of Rearden 
Metal to the State Science Institute. We should like to have five thousand 
tons by the first of December, and then we'll be quite agreeable to waiting 
for the balance of the order until after the first of the year." 

Rearden sat looking at him silently for a long time; each passing moment 
had the effect of making the gay intonations of Dr. Ferris' voice, still 
hanging in the air of the room, seem more foolish. When Dr. Ferris had begun 
to dread that he would not answer at all, Rearden answered, "Hasn't the 
traffic cop with the leather leggings, whom you sent here, given you a report 
on his conversation with me?" 

"Why, yes, Mr. Rearden, but—" 

"What else do you want to hear?" 

"But that was five months ago, Mr. Rearden. A certain event has taken 
place since, which makes me quite sure that you have changed your mind and 
that you will make no trouble for us at all, just as we will make no trouble 
for you . " 

"What event?" 



"An event of which you have far greater knowledge than I— but, you see, I 
do have knowledge of it, even though you would much prefer me to have none." 
"What event?" 

"Since it is your secret, Mr. Rearden, why not let it remain a secret? 

Who doesn't have secrets nowadays? For instance, Project X is a secret. 

You realize, of course, that we could obtain your Metal simply by having 
it purchased in smaller quantities by various government offices who would 
then transfer it to us— and you would not be able to prevent it. 

But this would necessitate our letting a lot of lousy bureaucrats"— Dr . 

Ferris smiled with disarming frankness— "oh yes, we are as unpopular with 
one another as we are with you private citizens— it would necessitate our 
letting a lot of other bureaucrats in on the secret of Project X, which would 
be highly undesirable at this time. And so would any newspaper publicity 
about the Project— if we put you on trial for refusal to comply with a 
government order. But if you had to stand trial on another, much more serious 
charge, where Project X and the State Science Institute were not involved, 
and where you could not raise any issue of principle or arouse any public 
sympathy— why, that would not inconvenience us at all, but it would cost you 
more than you would care to contemplate. Therefore, the only practical thing 
for you to do is to help us keep our secret and get us to help you keep 
yours— and, as I'm sure you realize, we are fully able to keep any of the 
bureaucrats safely off your trail for as long as we wish, " 

"What event, what secret and what trail?" 

"Oh, come, Mr. Rearden, don't be childish! The four thousand tons of 
Rearden Metal which you delivered to Ken Danagger, of course, " 
said Dr. Ferris lightly. 
Rearden did not answer. 

"Issues of. principle are such a nuisance," said Dr. Ferris, smiling, "and 
such a waste of time for all concerned. Now would you care to be a martyr for 
an issue of principle, only in circumstances where nobody will know that 
that's what you are— nobody but you and me— where you won't get a chance to 
breathe a word about the issue or the principle— where you won't be a hero, 
the creator of a spectacular new metal, making a stand against enemies whose 
actions might appear somewhat shabby in the eyes of the public— where you 
won't be a hero, but a common criminal, a greedy industrialist who's cheated 
the law for a plain motive of profit, a racketeer of the black market who's 
broken the national regulations designed to protect the public welfare— a hero 
without glory and without public, who'll accomplish no more than about half a 
column of newsprint somewhere on page five— now would you still care to be 
that kind of martyr? Because that's just what the issue amounts to now: 
either you let us have the Metal or you go to jail for ten years and take 
your friend Danagger along, too." 

As a biologist, Dr. Ferris had always been fascinated by the theory that 
animals had the capacity to smell fear; he had tried to develop a similar 
capacity in himself. Watching Rearden, he concluded that the man had long 
since decided to give in— because he caught no trace of any fear. 

"Who was your informer?" asked Rearden. 

"One of your friends, Mr. Rearden. The owner of a copper mine in Arizona, 
who reported to us that you had purchased an extra amount of copper last 
month, above the regular tonnage required for the monthly quota of Rearden 
Metal which the law permits you to produce. Copper is one of the ingredients 
of Rearden Metal, isn't it? That was all the information we needed. The rest 
was easy to trace. You mustn't blame that mine owner too much. The copper 
producers, as you know, are being squeezed so badly right now that the man 
had to offer something of value in order to obtain a favor, an 'emergency 
need' ruling which suspended a few of the directives in his case and gave him 
a little breathing spell. The person to whom he traded his information knew 



where it would have the highest value, so he traded it to me, in return for 
certain favors he needed. So all the necessary evidence, as well as the next 
ten years of your life, are now in my possession— and I am offering you a 
trade. I'm sure you won't object, since trade is your specialty. The form may 
be a little different from what it was in your youth— but you're a smart 
trader, you've always known how to take advantage of changing conditions, and 
these are the conditions of our day, so it should not be difficult for you to 
see where your interests lie and to act accordingly." 

Rearden said calmly, "In my youth, this was called blackmail." 

Dr. Ferris grinned. "That's what it is, Mr. Rearden. We've entered a much 
more realistic age." 

But there was a peculiar difference, thought Rearden, between the manner 
of a plain blackmailer and that of Dr. Ferris. A blackmailer would show signs 
of gloating over his victim's sin and of acknowledging its evil, he would 
suggest a threat to the victim and a sense of danger to them both. Dr. Ferris 
conveyed none of it. His manner was that of dealing with the normal and the 
natural, it suggested a sense of safety, it held no tone of condemnation, but 
a hint of comradeship, a comradeship based— for both of them— on self -contempt . 
The sudden feeling that made Rearden lean forward in a posture of eager 
attentiveness , was the feeling that he was about to discover another step 
along his half glimpsed trail. 

Seeing Rearden' s look of interest, Dr. Ferris smiled and congratulated 
himself on having caught the right key. The game was clear to him now, the 
markings of the pattern were falling in the right order; some men, thought 
Dr. Ferris, would do anything so long as it was left unnamed, but this man 
wanted frankness, this was the tough realist he had expected to find. 

"You're a practical man, Mr. Rearden," said Dr. Ferris amiably. "I can't 
understand why you should want to stay behind the times. Why don't you adjust 
yourself and play it right? You're smarter than most of them. You're a 
valuable person, we've wanted you for a long time, and when I heard that you 
were trying to string along with Jim Taggart, I knew you could be had. Don't 
bother with Jim Taggart, he's nothing, he's just flea-bait. Get into the big 
game. We can use you and you can use us. Want us to step on Orren Boyle for 
you? He's given you an awful beating, want us to trim him down a little? It 
can be done. Or want us to keep Ken Danagger in line? Look how impractical 
you've been about that. I know why you sold him the Metal— it's because you 
need him to get coal from. So you take a chance on going to jail and paying 
huge fines, just to keep on the good side of Ken Danagger. Do you call that 
good business? Now, make a deal with us and just let Mr. Danagger understand 
that if he doesn't toe the line, he'll go to jail, but you won't, because 
you've got friends he hasn't got— and you'll never have to worry about your 
coal supply from then on. Now that's the modern way of doing business. Ask 
yourself which way is more practical. And whatever anyone's said about you, 
nobody's ever denied that you're a great businessman and a hard-headed 
realist . " 

"That's what I am," said Rearden. 

"That's what I thought," said Dr. Ferris. "You rose to riches in an age 
when most men were going bankrupt, you've always managed to blast obstacles, 
to keep your mills going and to make money— that ' s your reputation— so you 
wouldn't want to be impractical now, would you? What for? What do you care, 
so long as you make money? Leave the theories to people like Bertram Scudder 
and the ideals to people like Balph Eubank— and be yourself. Come down to 
earth. You're not the man who'd let sentiment interfere with business." 

"No," said Rearden slowly, "I wouldn't. Not any kind of sentiment." 

Dr. Ferris smiled. "Don't you suppose we knew it?" he said, his tone 
suggesting that he was letting his patent-leather hair down to impress a 
fellow criminal by a display of superior cunning. "We've waited a long time 



to get something on you. You honest men are such a problem and such a 
headache. But we knew you'd slip sooner or later— and this is just what we 
wanted. " 

"You seem to be pleased about it." 

"Don't I have good reason to be?" 

"But, after all, I did break one of your laws." 

"Well, what do you think they're for?" 

Dr. Ferris did not notice the sudden look on Rearden's face, the look of a 
man hit by the first vision of that which he had sought to see. 

Dr. Ferris was past the stage of seeing; he was intent upon delivering the 
last blows to an animal caught in a trap. 

"Did you really think that we want those laws to be observed?" said Dr. 
Ferris. "We want them broken. You'd better get it straight that it's not a 
bunch of boy scouts you're up against— then you'll know that this is not the 
age for beautiful gestures. We're after power and we mean it. 

You fellows were pikers, but we know the real trick, and you'd better get 
wise to it. There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any 
government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there 
aren't enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a 
crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. Who 
wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What's there in that for anyone? But 
just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced nor 
objectively interpreted— and you create a nation of law-breakers— and then you 
cash in on guilt. Now that's the system, Mr. Rearden, that's the game, and 
once you understand it, you'll be much easier to deal with." 

Watching Dr. Ferris watch him, Rearden saw the sudden twitch of anxiety, 
the look that precedes panic, as if a clean card had fallen on the table from 
a deck Dr. Ferris had never seen before. 

What Dr. Ferris was seeing in Rearden's face was the look of luminous 
serenity that comes from the sudden answer to an old, dark problem, a look of 
relaxation and eagerness together; there was a youthful clarity in Rearden's 
eyes and the faintest touch of contempt in the line of his mouth. Whatever 
this meant— and Dr. Ferris could not decipher it —he was certain of one thing: 
the face held no sign of guilt. 

"There's a flaw in your system, Dr. Ferris," Rearden said quietly, almost 
lightly, "a practical flaw which you will discover when you put me on trial 
for selling four thousand tons of Rearden Metal to Ken Danagger." 

It took twenty seconds— Rearden could feel them moving past slowly— at the 
end of which Dr. Ferris became convinced that he had heard Rearden's final 
decision . 

"Do you think we're bluffing?" snapped Dr. Ferris; his voice suddenly had 
the quality of the animals he had spent so much time studying: it sounded as 
if he were baring his teeth. 

"I don't know," said Rearden. "I don't care, one way or the other." 

"Are you going to be as impractical as that?" 

"The evaluation of an action as 'practical, ' Dr. Ferris, depends on what 
it is that one wishes to practice." 

"Haven't you always placed your self-interest above all else?" 

"That is what I am doing right now." 

"If you think we'll let you get away with a—" 

"You will now please get out of here." 

"Whom do you think you're fooling?" Dr. Ferris' voice had risen close to 
the edge of a scream. "The day of the barons of industry is done! You've got 
the goods, but we've got the goods on you, and you're going to play it our 
way or you'll—" 

Rearden had pressed a button; Miss Ives entered the office. 

"Dr. Ferris has become confused and has lost his way, Miss Ives," 



said Rearden. "Will you escort him out please?" He turned to Ferris. 

"Miss Ives is a woman, she weighs about a hundred pounds, and she has no 
practical qualifications at all, only a superlative intellectual efficiency. 
She would never do for a bouncer in a saloon, only in an impractical place, 
such as a factory." 

Miss Ives looked as if she was performing a duty of no greater emotional 
significance than taking dictation about a list of shipping invoices. 
Standing straight in a disciplined manner of icy formality, she held the door 
open, let Dr. Ferris cross the room, then walked out first; Dr. Ferris 
followed . 

She came back a few minutes later, laughing in uncontrollable exultation. 

"Mr. Rearden," she asked, laughing at her fear for him, at their danger, 
at everything but the triumph of the moment, "what is it you're doing?" 

He sat in a pose he had never permitted himself before, a pose he had 
resented as the most vulgar symbol of the businessman— he sat leaning back in 
his chair, with his feet on his desk— and it seemed to her that the posture 
had an air of peculiar nobility, that it was not the pose of a stuffy 
executive, but of a young crusader. 

"I think I'm discovering a new continent, Owen," he answered cheerfully. 
"A continent that should have been discovered along with America, but 
wasn ' t . " 

"I have to speak of it to you" said Eddie Willers, looking at the worker 
across the table. "I don't know why it helps me, but it does- 
just to know that you're hearing me." 

It was late and the lights of the underground cafeteria were low, but 
Eddie Willers could see the worker's eyes looking at him intently. 

"I feel as if . . .as if there's no people and no human language left," 
said Eddie Willers. "I feel that if I were to scream in the middle of the 
streets, there would be no one to hear it. . . . No, that's not quite what I 
feel, it's this: I feel that someone is screaming in the middle of the 
streets, but people are passing by and no sound can reach them —and it's not 
Hank Rearden or Ken Danagger or I who's screaming, and yet it seems as if 
it's all three of us. . . . Don't you see that somebody should have risen to 
defend them, but nobody has or will? 

Rearden and Danagger were indicted this morning— for an illegal sale of 
Rearden Metal. They'll go on trial next month. I was there, in the courtroom 
in Philadelphia, when they read the indictment. Rearden was very calm— I kept 
feeling that he was smiling, but he wasn't. 

Danagger was worse than calm. He didn't say a word, he just stood there, 
as if the room were empty. . . . The newspapers are saying that both of them 
should be thrown in jail. . . . No . . . no, I'm not shaking, I'm all right, 
I'll be all right in a moment. . . . That's why I haven't said a word to her, 
I was afraid I'd explode and I didn't want to make it harder for her, I know 
how she feels. ... Oh yes, she spoke to me about it, and she didn't shake, 
but it was worse— 

you know, the kind of rigidity when a person acts as if she didn't feel 
anything at all, and . . . Listen, did I ever tell you that I like you? 
I like you very much— for the way you look right now. You hear us. 
You understand . . . What did she say? It was strange: it's not Hank 
Rearden that she's afraid for, it's Ken Danagger. She said that Rearden will 
have the strength to take it, but Danagger won't. Not that he'll lack the 
strength, but he'll refuse to take it. She . . . she feels certain that Ken 
Danagger will be the next one to go. To go like Ellis Wyatt and all those 
others. To give up and vanish . . . Why? 

Well, she thinks that there's something like a shift of stress involved- 
economic and personal stress. As soon as all the weight of the moment 
shifts to the shoulders of some one man— he ' s the one who vanishes, like a 



pillar slashed off. A year ago, nothing worse could have happened to 'the 
country than to lose Ellis Wyatt. He's the one we lost. 

Since then, she says, it's been as if the center of gravity were swinging 
wildly— like in a sinking cargo ship out of control— shifting from industry to 
industry, from man to man. When we lose one, another becomes that much more 
desperately needed— and he's the one we lose next. Well, what could be a 
greater disaster now than to have the country's coal supply left in the hands 
of men like Boyle or Larkin? 

And there's no one left in the coal industry who amounts to much, except 
Ken Danagger. So she says that she feels almost as if he's a marked man, as 
if he's hit by a spotlight right now, waiting to be cut down. . . . What are 
you laughing at? It might sound preposterous, but I think it's true. . . . 
What? . . . Oh yes, you bet she's a smart woman! . . . And then there's 
another thing involved, she says. A man has to come to a certain mental 
stage— not anger or despair, but something much, much more than both— before he 
can be cut down. 

She can't tell what it is, but she knew, long before the fire, that Ellis 
Wyatt had reached that stage and something would happen to him. 

When she saw Ken Danagger in the courtroom today, she said that he was 
ready for the destroyer. . . . Yes, that's the words she used: he was ready 
for the destroyer. You see, she doesn't think it's happening by chance or 
accident. She thinks there's a system behind it, an intention, a man. There's 
a destroyer loose in the country, who's cutting down the buttresses one after 
another to let the structure collapse upon our heads. Some ruthless creature 
moved by some inconceivable purpose . . . She says that she won't let him get 
Ken Danagger. She keeps repeating that she must stop Danagger— she wants to 
speak to him, to beg, to plead, to revive whatever it is that he's losing, to 
arm him against the destroyer, before the destroyer comes. She's desperately 
anxious to reach Danagger first. He has refused to see anyone. He's gone back 
to Pittsburgh, to his mines. But she got him on the phone, late today, and 
she's made an appointment to see him tomorrow afternoon. . . . Yes, she'll go 
to Pittsburgh tomorrow. . . . Yes, she's afraid for Danagger, terribly 
afraid. . . . No. She knows nothing about the destroyer. She has no clue to 
his identity, no evidence of his existence— except the trail of destruction. 
But she feels certain that he exists. . . . No, she cannot guess his purpose. 
She says that nothing on earth could justify him. There are times when she 
feels that she'd like to find him more than any other man in the world, more 
than the inventor of the motor. She says that if she found the destroyer, 
she'd shoot him on sight— she'd be willing to give her life if she could take 
his first and by her own hand . . . because he's the most evil creature 
that's ever existed, the man who's draining the brains of the world. 

. . . I guess it's getting to be too much for her, at times— even for her. 
I don't think she allows herself to know how tired she is. The other morning, 
I came to work very early and I found her asleep on the couch in her office, 
with the light still burning on her desk. She'd been there all night. I just 
stood and looked at her. I wouldn't have awakened her if the whole goddamn 
railroad collapsed. . . . When she was asleep? Why, she looked like a young 
girl. She looked as if she felt certain that she would awaken in a world 
where no one would harm her, as if she had nothing to hide or to fear. That's 
what was terrible— that guiltless purity of her face, with her body twisted by 
exhaustion, still lying there as she had collapsed. She looked— say, why 
should you ask me what she looks like when she's asleep? . . . 

Yes, you're right, why do I talk about it? I shouldn't. I don't know what 
made me think of it. . . . Don't pay any attention to me. I'll be all right 
tomorrow. I guess it's just that I'm sort of shell-shocked by that courtroom. 
I keep thinking: if men like Rearden and Danagger are to be sent to jail, 
then what kind of world are we working in and what for? Isn't there any 



justice left on earth? I was foolish enough to say that to a reporter when we 
were leaving the courtroom— and he just laughed and said, 'Who is John Gait?' 
. . . Tell me, what's happening to us? Isn't there a single man of justice 
left? Isn't there anyone to defend them? Oh, do you hear me? Isn't there 
anyone to defend them?" 

"Mr. Danagger will be free in a moment, Miss Taggart. He has a visitor in 
his office. Will you excuse it, please?" said the secretary. 

Through the two hours of her flight to Pittsburgh, Dagny had been tensely 
unable to justify her anxiety or to dismiss it; there was no reason to count 
minutes, yet she had felt a blind desire to hurry. The anxiety vanished when 
she entered the anteroom of Ken Danagger 's office: she had reached him, 
nothing had happened to prevent it, she felt safety, confidence and an 
enormous sense of relief. 

The words of the secretary demolished it. You're becoming a coward— thought 
Dagny., feeling a causeless jolt of dread at the words, out of all proportion 
to their meaning. 

"I am so sorry, Miss Taggart." She heard the secretary's respectful, 
solicitous voice and realized that she had stood there without answering. 
"Mr. Danagger will be with you in just a moment. Won't you sit down?" The 
voice conveyed an anxious concern over the impropriety of keeping her 
waiting . 

Dagny smiled. "Oh, that's quite all right." 

She sat down in a wooden armchair, facing the secretary's railing. 

She reached for a cigarette and stopped, wondering whether she would have 
time to finish it, hoping that she would not, then lighted it brusquely. 

It was an old-fashioned frame building, this headquarters of the great 
Danagger Coal Company. Somewhere in the hills beyond the window were the pits 
where Ken Danagger had once worked as a miner. He had never moved his office 
away from the coal fields. 

She could see the mine entrances cut into the hillsides, small frames of 
metal girders, that led to an immense underground kingdom. They seemed 
precariously modest, lost in the violent orange and red of the hills. . . . 
Under a harsh blue sky, in the sunlight of late October, the sea of leaves 
looked like a sea of fire . . . like waves rolling to swallow the fragile 
posts of the mine doorways. She shuddered and looked away: she thought of the 
flaming leaves spread over the hills of Wisconsin, on the road to 
Starnesville . 

She noticed that there was only a stub left of the cigarette between her 
fingers. She lighted another. 

When she glanced at the clock on the wall of the anteroom, she caught the 
secretary glancing at it at the same time. Her appointment was for three 
o'clock; the white dial said: 3:12. 

"Please forgive it, Miss Taggart," said the secretary, "Mr. Danagger will 
be through, any moment now, Mr. Danagger is extremely punctual about Ms 
appointments. Please believe me that this is unprecedented." 

"I know it." She knew that Ken Danagger was as rigidly exact about his 
schedule as a railroad timetable and that he had been known to cancel an 
interview if a caller permitted himself to arrive five minutes late. 

The secretary was an elderly spinster with a forbidding manner: a manner 
of even-toned courtesy impervious to any shock, just as her spotless white 
blouse was impervious to an atmosphere filled with coal dust. Dagny thought 
it strange that a hardened, well-trained woman of this type should appear to 
be nervous: she volunteered no conversation, she sat still, bent over some 
pages of paper on her desk. Half of Dagny 's cigarette had gone in smoke, 
while the woman still sat looking at the same page. 

When she raised her head to glance at the clock, the 4ial said: 3:30. 



"I know that this is inexcusable, Miss Taggart." The note of apprehension 
was obvious in her voice now. "I am unable to understand it." 
"Would you mind telling Mr. Danagger that I'm here?" 

"I can't!" It was almost a cry; she saw Dagny's astonished glance and felt 
obliged to explain: "Mr. Danagger called me, on the interoffice communicator, 
and told me that he was not to be interrupted under any circumstances or for 
any reason whatever." 

"When did he do that?" 

The moment's pause was like a small air cushion for the answer: "Two hours 
ago . " 

Dagny looked at the closed door of Danagger 's office. She could hear the 
sound of a voice beyond the door, but so faintly that she could not tell 
whether it was the voice of one man or the conversation of two; she could not 
distinguish the words or the emotional quality of the tone: it was only a 
low, even progression of sounds that seemed normal and did not convey the 
pitch of raised voices. 

"How long has Mr. Danagger been in conference?" she asked. 

"Since one o'clock," said the secretary grimly, then added in apology, "It 
was an unscheduled caller, or Mr. Danagger would never have permitted this to 
happen . " 

The door was not locked, thought Dagny; she felt an unreasoning desire to 
tear it open and walk in— it was only a few wooden boards with a brass knob, 
it would require only a small muscular contraction of her arm— but she looked 
away, knowing that the power of a civilized order and of Ken Danagger 's right 
was more impregnable a barrier than any lock. 

She found herself staring at the stubs of her cigarettes in the ashtray 
stand beside her, and wondered why it gave her a sharper feeling of 
apprehension. Then she realized that she was thinking of Hugh Akston: she had 
written to him, at his diner in Wyoming, asking him to tell her where he had 
obtained the cigarette with the dollar sign; her letter had come back, with a 
postal inscription to inform her that he had moved away, leaving no 
forwarding address. 

She told herself angrily that this had no connection with the present 
moment and that she had to control her nerves. But her hand jerked to press 
the button of the ashtray and make the cigarette stubs vanish inside the 
stand . 

As she looked up, her eyes met the glance of the secretary watching her. 
"I am sorry, Miss Taggart. I don't know what to do about it." 

It was an openly desperate plea. "I don't dare interrupt." 

Dagny asked slowly, as a demand, in defiance of office etiquette, "Who is 
with Mr. Danagger?" 

"I don't know, Miss Taggart. I have never seen the gentleman before." She 
noticed the sudden, fixed stillness of Dagny's eyes and added, "I think it's 
a childhood friend of Mr. Danagger." 

"Oh!" said Dagny, relieved. 

"He came in unannounced and asked to see Mr. Danagger and said that this 
was an appointment which Mr. Danagger had made with him forty years ago," 
"How old is Mr. Danagger?" 

"Fifty-two," said the secretary. She added reflectively, in the tone of a 
casual remark, "Mr. Danagger started working at the age of twelve." 

After another silence, she added, "The strange thing is that the visitor 
does not look as if he's even forty years old. He seems to be a man in his 
thirties . " 

"Did he give his name?" 

"No . " 

"What does he look like?" 



The secretary smiled with sudden animation, as if she were about to utter 
an enthusiastic compliment, but the smile vanished abruptly. 

"I don't know," she answered uneasily. "He's hard to describe. He has a 
strange face." 

They had been silent for a long time, and the hands of the dial were 
approaching 3:50 when the buzzer rang on the secretary's desk— 

the bell from Danagger's office, the signal of permission to enter. 

They both leaped to their feet, and the secretary rushed forward, smiling 
with relief, hastening to open the door. 

As she entered Danagger's office, Dagny saw the private exit door closing 
after the caller who had preceded her. She heard the knock of the door 
against the jamb and the faint tinkle of the glass panel. 

She saw the man who had left, by his reflection on Ken Danagger's face. It 
was not the face she had seen in the courtroom, it was not the face she had 
known for years as a countenance of unchanging, unfeeling rigidity— it was a 
face which a young man of twenty should hope for, but could not achieve, a 
face from which every sign of strain had been wiped out, so that the lined 
cheeks, the creased forehead, the graying hair— like elements rearranged by a 
new theme— were made to form a composition of hope, eagerness and guiltless 
serenity: the theme was deliverance. 

He did not rise when she entered— he looked as if he had not quite returned 
to the reality of the moment and had forgotten the proper routine— but he 
smiled at her with such simple benevolence that she found herself smiling in 
answer. She caught herself thinking that this was the way every human being 
should greet another— and she lost her anxiety, feeling suddenly certain that 
all was well and that nothing to be feared could exist. 

"How do you do, Miss Taggart, " he said. "Forgive me, I think that I have 
kept you waiting. Please sit down." He pointed to the chair in front of his 
desk . 

"I didn't mind waiting," she said. "I'm grateful that you gave me this 
appointment. I was extremely anxious to speak to you on a matter of urgent 
importance . " 

He leaned forward across the desk, with a look of attentive concentration, 
as he always did at the mention of an important business matter, but she was 
not speaking to the man she knew, this was a stranger, and she stopped, 
uncertain about the arguments she had been prepared to use. 

He looked at her in silence, and then he said, "Miss Taggart, this is such 
a beautiful day— probably the last, this year. There's a thing I've always 
wanted to do, but never had time for it. Let's go back to New York together 
and take one of those excursion boat trips around the island of Manhattan. 
Let's take a last look at the greatest city in the world." 

She sat still, trying to hold her eyes fixed in order to stop the office 
from swaying. This was the Ken Danagger who had never had a personal friend, 
had never married, had never attended a play or a movie, had never permitted 
anyone the impertinence of taking his time for any concern but business. 

"Mr. Danagger, I came here to speak to you about a matter of crucial 
importance to the future of your business and mine. I came to speak to you 
about your indictment." 

"Oh, that? Don't worry about that. It doesn't matter. I'm going to 
retire . " 

She sat still, feeling nothing, wondering numbly whether this was how it 
felt to hear a death sentence one had dreaded, but had never quite believed 
possible . 

Her first movement was a sudden jerk of her head toward the exit door; she 
asked, her voice low, her mouth distorted by hatred, "Who was he?" 

Danagger laughed. "If you've guessed that much, you should have guessed 
that it's a question I won't answer." 



"Oh God, Ken Danagger!" she moaned; his words made her realize that the 
barrier of hopelessness, of silence, of unanswered questions was already 
erected between them; the hatred had been only a thin wire that had held her 
for a moment and she broke with its breaking. 

"Oh God!" 

"You're wrong, kid," he said gently. "I know how you feel, but you're 
wrong, " then added more formally, as if remembering the proper manner, as if 
still trying to balance himself between two kinds of reality, "I'm sorry, 
Miss Taggart, that you had to come here so soon after." 

"I came too late," she said. "That's what I came here to prevent. I knew 
it would happen." 

"Why?" 

"I felt certain that he'd get you next, whoever he is." 
"You did? That's funny. I didn't." 

"I wanted to warn you, to ... to arm you against him." 

He smiled. "Take my word for it, Miss Taggart, so that you won't torture 
yourself with regrets about the timing; that could not have been done." 

She felt that with every passing minute he was moving away into some great 
distance where she would not be able to reach him, but there was still some 
thin bridge left between them and she had to hurry. 

She leaned forward, she said very quietly, the intensity of emotion taking 
form in the exaggerated steadiness of her voice, "Do you remember what you 
thought and felt, what you were, three hours ago? Do you remember what your 
mines meant to you? Do you remember Taggart Transcontinental or Rearden 
Steel? In the name of that, will you answer me? Will you help me to 
understand? " 

"I will answer whatever I may." 

"You have decided to retire? To give up your business?" 
"Yes . " 

"Does it mean nothing to you now?" 

"It means more to me now than it ever did before." 
"But you're going to abandon it?" 
"Yes . " 
"Why?" 

"That, I won't answer," 

"You, who loved your work, who respected nothing but work, who despised 
every kind of aimlessness, passivity and renunciation— have you renounced the 
kind of life you loved?" 

"No. I have just discovered how much I do love it." 

"But you intend to exist without work or purpose?" 

"What makes you think that?" 

"Are you going into the coal-mining business somewhere else?" 

"No, not into the coal-mining business." 

"Then what are you going to do?" 

"I haven't decided that yet." 

"Where are you going?" 

"I won't answer." 

She gave herself a moment's pause, to gather her strength, to tell 
herself; Don't feel, don't show him that you feel anything, don't let it 
cloud and break the bridge— then she said, in the same quiet, even voice, "Do 
you realize what your retirement will do to Hank Rearden, to me, to all the 
rest of us, whoever is left?" 

"Yes. I realize it more fully than you do at present." 

"And it means nothing to you?" 

"It means more than you will care to believe." 
"Then why are you deserting us?" 



"You will not believe it and I will not explain, but I am not deserting 
you . " 

"We're being left to carry a greater burden, and you're indifferent to the 
knowledge that you'll see us destroyed by the looters." 
"Don't be too sure of that." 

"Of which? Your indifference or our destruction?" 
"Of either." 

"But you know, you knew it this morning, that it's a battle to the death, 
and it's we— you were one of us— against the looters." 

"If I answer that 7 know it, but you don't— you'll think that I attach no 
meaning to my words. So take it as you wish, but that is my answer." 

"Will you tell me the meaning?" 

"No. It's for you to discover." 

"You're willing to give up the world to the looters. We aren't." 
"Don't be too sure of either." 

She remained helplessly silent. The strangeness of his manner was its 
simplicity; he spoke as if he were being completely natural and— in the midst 
of unanswered questions and of a tragic mystery— he conveyed the impression 
that there were no secrets any longer, and no mystery need ever have existed. 

But as she watched him, she saw the first break in his joyous calm: she 
saw him struggling against some thought; he hesitated, then said, with 
effort, "About Hank Rearden . . . Will you do me a favor?" 

"Of course." 

"Will you tell him that I . . . You see, I've never cared for people, yet 
he was always the man I respected, but I didn't know until today that what I 
felt was, . . . that he was the only man I ever loved. . . . 

Just tell him this and that I wish I could— no, I guess that's all I can 
tell him. . . .He'll probably damn me for leaving . . . still, maybe he 
won ' t . " 

"I'll tell him." 

Hearing the dulled, hidden sound of pain in his voice, she felt so close 
to him that it seemed impossible he would deliver the blow he was delivering— 
and she made one last effort. 

"Mr. Danagger, if I were to plead on my knees, if I were to find some sort 
of words that I haven't found— would there be ... is there a chance to stop 
you?" 

"There isn't." 

After a moment, she asked tonelessly, "When are you quitting?" 
"Tonight. " 

"What will you do with"— she pointed at the hills beyond the window— "the 
Danagger Coal Company? To whom are you leaving it?" 

"I don't know— or care. To nobody or everybody. To whoever wants to take 
it. " 

"You're not going to dispose of it or appoint a successor?" 
"No. What for?" 

"To leave it in good hands. Couldn't you at least name an heir of your own 
choice? " 

"I haven't any choice. It doesn't make any difference to me. Want me to 
leave it all to you?" He reached for a sheet of paper. "I'll write a letter 
naming you sole heiress right now, if you want me to." 

She shook her head in an involuntary recoil of horror. "I'm not a looter!" 

He chuckled, pushing the paper aside. "You see? You gave the right answer, 
whether you knew it or not. Don't worry about Danagger Coal. It won't make 
any difference, whether I appoint the best successor in the world, or the 
worst, or none. No matter who takes it over now, whether men or weeds, it 
won't make any difference." 



"But to walk off and abandon . . . just abandon ... an industrial 
enterprise, as if we were in the age of landless nomads or of savages 
wandering in the jungle!" 

"Aren't we?" He was smiling at her, half in mockery, half in compassion. 
"Why should I leave a deed or a will? I don't want to help the looters to 
pretend that private property still exists. I am complying with the system 
which they have established. They do not need me, they say, they only need my 
coal. Let them take it." 

"Then you're accepting their system?" 

"Am I?" 

She moaned, looking at the exit door, "What has he done to you?" 
"He told me that I had the right to exist." 

"I didn't believe it possible that in three hours one could make a man 
turn against fifty-two years of his life!" 

"If that's what you trunk he's done, or if you think that he's told me 
some inconceivable revelation, then I can see how bewildering it would appear 
to you. But that's not what he's done. He merely named what I had lived by, 
what every man lives by— at and to the extent of such time as he doesn't spend 
destroying himself." 

She knew that questions were futile and that there was nothing she could 
say to him. 

He looked at her bowed head and said gently, "You're a brave person, Miss 
Taggart. I know what you're doing right now and what it's costing you. Don't 
torture yourself. Let me go." 

She rose to her feet. She was about to speak— but suddenly he saw her stare 
down, leap forward and seize the ashtray that stood on the edge of the desk. 

The ashtray contained a cigarette butt stamped with the sign of the 
dollar . 

"What's the matter, Miss Taggart?" 
"Did he . . . did he smoke this?" 
"Who?" 

"Your caller— did he smoke this cigarette?" 

"Why, I don't know ... I guess so . . . yes, I think I did see him 
smoking a cigarette once . . . let me see . . . no, that's not my brand, so 
it must be his." 

"Were there any other visitors in this office today?" 

"No. But why, Miss Taggart? What's the matter?" 

"May I take this?" 

"What? The cigarette butt?" He stared at her in bewilderment. 
"Yes . " 

"Why, sure— but what for?" 

She was looking down at the butt in the palm of her hand as if it were a 
jewel. "I don't know ... I don't know what good it will do me, except that 
it's a clue to"— she smiled bitterly— "to a secret of my own." 

She stood, reluctant to leave, looking at Ken Danagger in the manner of a 
last look at one departing for the realm of no return. 

He guessed it, smiled and extended his hand. "I won't say goodbye," he 
said, "because I'll see you again in the not too distant future." 

"Oh, " she said eagerly, holding his hand clasped across the desk, "are you 
going to return?" 

"No. You're going to join me." 

There was only a faint red breath above the structures in the darkness, as 
if the mills were asleep but alive, with the even breathing of the furnaces 
and the distant heartbeats of the conveyor belts to show it. 

Rearden stood at the window of his office, his hand pressed to the pane; 
in the perspective of distance, his hand covered half a mile of structures, 
as if he were trying to hold them. 



He was looking at a long wall of vertical strips, which was the battery of 
coke ovens. A narrow door slid open with a brief gasp of flame, and a sheet 
of red-glowing coke came sliding out smoothly, like a slice of bread from the 
side of a giant toaster. It held still for an instant, then an angular crack 
shot through the slice and it crumbled into a gondola waiting on the rails 
below . 

Danagger coal, he thought. These were the only words in his mind. 

The rest was a feeling of loneliness, so vast that even its own pain 
seemed swallowed in an enormous void. 

Yesterday, Dagny had told him the story of her futile attempt and given 
him Danagger 's message. This morning, he had heard the news that Danagger had 
disappeared. Through his sleepless night, then through the taut concentration 
on the duties of the day, his answer to the message had kept beating in his 
mind, the answer he would never have a chance to utter. 

"The only man I ever loved." It came from Ken Danagger, who had never 
expressed anything more personal than "Look here, Rearden." 

He thought: Why had we let it go? Why had we both been condemned —in the 
hours away from our desks— to an exile among dreary strangers who had made us 
give up all desire for rest, for friendship, for the sound of human voices? 
Could I now reclaim a single hour spent listening to my brother Philip and 
give it to Ken Danagger? Who made it our duty to accept, as the only reward 
for our work, the gray torture of pretending love for those who roused us to 
nothing but contempt? 

We who were able to melt rock and metal for our purpose, why had we never 
sought that which we wanted from men? 

He tried to choke the words in his mind, knowing that it was useless to 
think of them now. But the words were there and they were like words 
addressed to the dead: No, I don't damn you for leaving— if that is the 
question and the pain which you took away with you. Why didn't you give me a 
chance to tell you . . . what? that I approve? 

. . . no, but that I can neither blame you nor follow you. 

Closing his eyes, he permitted himself to experience for a moment the 
immense relief he would feel if he, too, were to walk off, abandoning 
everything. Under the shock of his loss, he felt a thin thread of envy. Why 
didn't they come for me, too, whoever they are, and give me that irresistible 
reason which would make me go? But in the next moment, his shudder of anger 
told him that he would murder the man who'd attempt to approach him, he would 
murder before he could hear the words of the secret that would take him away 
from his mills. 

It was late, his staff had gone, but he dreaded the road to his house and 
the emptiness of the evening ahead. He felt as if the enemy who had wiped out 
Ken Danagger, were waiting for him in the darkness beyond the glow of the 
mills. He was not invulnerable any longer, but whatever it was, he thought, 
wherever it came from, he was safe from it here, as in a circle of fires 
drawn about him to ward off evil. 

He looked at the glittering white splashes on the dark windows of a 
structure in the distance; they were like motionless ripples of sunlight on 
water. It was the reflection of the neon sign that burned on the roof of the 
building above his head, saying: Rearden Steel. He thought of the night when 
he had wished to light a sign above his past, saying: Rearden Life. Why had 
he wished it? For whose eyes to see? 

He thought— in bitter astonishment and for the first time— that the joyous 
pride he had once felt, had come from his respect for men, for the value of 
their admiration and their judgment. He did not feel it any longer. There 
were no men, he thought, to whose sight he could wish to offer that sign. 

He turned brusquely away from the window. He seized his overcoat with the 
harsh sweep of a gesture intended to jolt him back into the discipline of 



action. He slammed the two folds of the overcoat about his body, he jerked 
the belt tight, then hastened to turn off the lights with rapid snaps of his 
hand on his way out of the office. 

He threw the door open— and stopped. A single lamp was burning in a corner 
of the dimmed anteroom. The man who sat on the edge of a desk, in a pose of 
casual, patient waiting, was Francisco d'Anconia. 

Rearden stood still and caught a brief instant when Francisco, not moving, 
looked at him with the hint of an amused smile that was like a wink between 
conspirators at a secret they both understood, but would not acknowledge. It 
was only an instant, almost too brief to grasp, because it seemed to him that 
Francisco rose at once at his entrance, with a movement of courteous 
deference. The movement suggested a strict formality, the denial of any 
attempt at presumption— but it stressed the intimacy of the fact that he 
uttered no word of greeting or explanation. 

Rearden asked, his voice hard, "What are you doing here?" 

"I thought that you would want to see me tonight, Mr. Rearden." 

"Why?" 

"For the same reason that has kept you so late in your office. You were 
not working." 

"How long have you been sitting here?" 
"An hour or two." 

"Why didn't you knock at my door?" 
"Would you have allowed me to come in?" 
"You're late in asking that question," 
"Shall I leave, Mr. Rearden?" 

Rearden pointed to the door of his office. "Come in." 

Turning the lights on in the office, moving with unhurried control, 
Rearden thought that he must not allow himself to feel anything, but felt the 
color of life returning to him in the tensely quiet eagerness of an emotion 
which he would not identify. What he told himself consciously was: Be 
careful . 

He sat down on the edge of his desk, crossed his arms, looked at 
Francisco, who remained standing respectfully before him, and asked with the 
cold hint of a smile, "Why did you come here?" 

"You don't want me to answer, Mr. Rearden. You wouldn't admit to me or to 
yourself how desperately lonely you are tonight. If you don't question me, 
you won't feel obliged to deny it. Just accept what you do know, anyway: that 
I know it." 

Taut like a string pulled by anger against the impertinence at one end and 
by admiration for the frankness at the other, Rearden answered, "I'll admit 
it, if you wish. What should it matter to me, that you know it?" 

"That I know and care, Mr. Rearden. I'm the only man around you who does." 

"Why should you care? And why should I need your help tonight?" 

"Because it's not easy to have to damn the man who meant most to you." 

"I wouldn't damn you if you'd only stay away from me." 

Francisco's eyes widened a little, then he grinned and said, "I was 
speaking of Mr. Danagger." 

For an instant, Rearden looked as if he wanted to slap his own face, then 
he laughed softly and said, "All right. Sit down." 

He waited to see what advantage Francisco would take of it now, but 
Francisco obeyed him in silence, with a smile that had an oddly boyish 
quality: a look of triumph and gratitude, together. 

"I don't damn Ken Danagger," said Rearden. 

"You don't?" The two words seemed to fall with a singular emphasis; they 
were pronounced very quietly, almost cautiously, with no remnant of a smile 
on Francisco's face. 

"No. I don't try to prescribe how much a man should have to bear. 



If he broke, it's not for me to judge him." 
"If he broke . . . ?" 
"Well, didn't he?" 

Francisco leaned back; his smile returned, but it was not a happy smile. 
"What will his disappearance do to you?" 

"I will just have to work a little harder." 

Francisco looked at a steel bridge traced in black strokes against red 
steam beyond the window, and said, pointing, "Every one of those girders has 
a limit to the load it can carry. What's yours?" 

Rearden laughed. "Is that what you're afraid of? Is that why you came 
here? Were you afraid I'd break? Did you want to save me, as Dagny Taggart 
wanted to save Ken Danagger? She tried to reach him in time, but couldn't." 

"She did? I didn't know it. Miss Taggart and I disagree about many 
things . " 

"Don't worry. I'm not going to vanish. Let them all give up and stop 
working. I won't. I don't know my limit and don't care. All I have to know is 
that I can't be stopped." 

"Any man can be stopped, Mr. Rearden." 

"How?" 

"It's only a matter of knowing man's motive power." 
"What is it?" 

"You ought to know, Mr. Rearden. You're one of the last moral men left to 
the world." 

Rearden chuckled in bitter amusement. "I've been called just about 
everything but that. And you're wrong. You have no idea how wrong." 
"Are you sure?" 

"I ought to know. Moral? What on earth made you say it?" 
Francisco pointed to the mills beyond the window. "This." 

For a long moment, Rearden looked at him without moving, then asked only, 
"What do you mean?" 

"If you want to see an abstract principle, such as moral action, in 
material form— there it is. Look at it, Mr. Rearden. Every girder of it, every 
pipe, wire and valve was put there by a choice in answer to the question: 
right or wrong? You had to choose right and you had to choose the best within 
your knowledge— the best for your purpose, which was to make steel— and then 
move on and extend the knowledge, and do better, and still better, with your 
purpose as your standard of value. You had to act on your own judgment, you 
had to have the capacity to judge, the courage to stand on the verdict of 
your mind, and the purest, the most ruthless consecration to the rule of 
doing right, of doing the best, the utmost best possible to you. Nothing 
could have made you act against your judgment, and you would have rejected as 
wrong— as evil— any man who attempted to tell you that the best way to heat a 
furnace was to fill it with ice. Millions of men, an entire nation, were not 
able to deter you from producing Rearden Metal— because you had the knowledge 
of its superlative value and the power which such knowledge gives. But what I 
wonder about, Mr. Rearden, is why you live by one code of principles when you 
deal with nature and by another when you deal with men?" 

Rearden 's eyes were fixed on him so intently that the question came 
slowly, as if the effort to pronounce it were a distraction: "What do you 
mean? " 

"Why don't you hold to the purpose of your life as clearly and rigidly as 
you hold to the purpose of your mills?" 
"What do you mean?" 

"You have judged every brick within this place by its value to the goal of 
making steel. Have you been as strict about the goal which your work and your 
steel are serving? What do you wish to achieve by giving your life to the 
making of steel? By what standard of value do you judge your days? For 



instance, why did you spend ten years of exacting effort to produce Rearden 
Metal?" 

Rearden looked away, the slight, slumping movement of his shoulders like a 
sigh of release and disappointment. "If you have to ask that, then you 
wouldn't understand." 

"If I told you that I understand it, but you don't— would you throw me out 
of here?" 

"T should have thrown you out of here anyway— so go ahead, tell me what you 
mean . " 

"Are you proud of the rail of the John Gait Line?" 

"Yes." 

"Why?" 

"Because it's the best rail ever made." 
"Why did you make it?" 
"In order to make money." 

"There were many easier ways to make money. Why did you choose the 
hardest?" 

"You said it in your speech at Taggart ' s wedding: in order to exchange my 
best effort for the best effort of others." 

"If that was your purpose, have you achieved it?" 

A beat of time vanished in a heavy drop of silence. "No," said Rearden. 
"Have you made any money?" 
"No . " 

"When you strain your energy to its utmost in order to produce the best, 
do you expect to be rewarded for it or punished?" Rearden did not answer. "By 
every standard of decency, of honor, of justice known to you— are you 
convinced that you should have been rewarded for it?" 

"Yes," said Rearden, his voice low. 

"Then if you were punished, instead— what sort of code have you accepted?" 
Rearden did not answer. 

"It is generally assumed, " said Francisco, "that living in a human society 
makes one's life much easier and safer than if one were left alone to 
struggle against nature on a desert island. Now wherever there is a man who 
needs or uses metal in any way — Rearden Metal has made his life easier for 
him. Has it made yours easier for you?" 

"No," said Rearden, his voice low. 

"Has it left your life as it was before you produced the Metal?" 
"No—" said Rearden, the word breaking off as if he had cut short the 
thought that followed. 

Francisco's voice lashed at him suddenly, as a command: "Say it!" 
"It has made it harder," said Rearden tonelessly. 

"When you felt proud of the rail of the John Gait Line, " said Francisco, 
the measured rhythm of his voice giving a ruthless clarity to his words, 
"what sort of men did you think of? Did you want to see that Line used by 
your equals— by giants of productive energy, such as Ellis Wyatt, whom it 
would help to reach higher and still higher achievements of their own?" 

"Yes," said Rearden eagerly. 

"Did you want to see it used by men who could not equal the power of your 
mind, but who would equal your moral integrity— men such as Eddie Willers— who 
could never invent your Metal, but who would do their best, work as hard as 
you did, live by their own effort, and— riding on your rail— give a moment's 
silent thanks to the man who gave them more than they could give him?" 

"Yes," said Rearden gently. 

"Did you want to see it used by whining rotters who never rouse themselves 
to any effort, who do not possess the ability of a filing clerk, but demand 
the income of a company president, who drift from failure to failure and 
expect you to pay their bills, who hold their wishing as an equivalent of 



your work and their need as a higher claim to reward than your effort, who 
demand that you serve them, who demand that it be the aim of your life to 
serve them, who demand that your strength be the voiceless, rightless, 
unpaid, unrewarded slave of their impotence, who proclaim that you are born 
to serfdom by reason of your genius, while they are born to rule by the grace 
of incompetence, that yours is only to give, but theirs only to take, that 
yours is to produce, but theirs to consume, that you are not to be paid, 
neither in matter nor in spirit, neither by wealth nor by recognition nor by 
respect nor by gratitude— so that they would ride on your rail and sneer at 
you and curse you, since they owe you nothing, not even the effort of taking 
off their hats which you paid for? Would this be what you wanted? Would you 
feel proud of it?" 

'I'd blast that rail first," said Rearden, his lips white. 

'Then why don't you do it, Mr. Rearden? Of the three kinds of men I 
described— which men are being destroyed and which are using your Line today?" 

They heard the distant metal heartbeats of the mills through the long 
thread of silence. 

"What I described last," said Francisco, "is any man who proclaims his 
right to a single penny of another man's effort." 

Rearden did not answer; he was looking at the reflection of a neon sign on 
dark windows in the distance. 

"You take pride in setting no limit to your endurance, Mr. Rearden, 
because you think that you are doing right. What if you aren't? What if 
you're placing your virtue in the service of evil and letting it become a 
tool for the destruction of everything you love, respect and admire? 

Why don't you uphold your own code of values among men as you do among 
iron smelters? You who won't allow one per cent of impurity into an alloy of 
metal— what have you allowed into your moral code?" 

Rearden sat very still; the words in his mind were like the beat of steps 
down the trail he had been seeking; the words were: the sanction of the 
victim. 

"You, who would not submit to the hardships of nature, but set out to 
conquer it and placed it in the service of your joy and your comfort— to what 
have you submitted at the hands of men? You, who know from your work that one 
bears punishment only for being wrong —what have you been willing to bear and 
for what reason? All your life, you have heard yourself denounced, not for 
your faults, but for your greatest virtues. You have been hated, not for your 
mistakes, but for your achievements. You have been scorned for all those 
qualities of character which are your highest pride. You have been called 
selfish for the courage of acting on your own judgment and bearing sole 
responsibility for your own life. You have been called arrogant for your 
independent mind. You have been called cruel for your unyielding integrity. 
You have been called anti-social for the vision that made you venture upon 
undiscovered roads. You have been called ruthless for the strength and self- 
discipline of your drive to your purpose. You have been called greedy for the 
magnificence of your power to create wealth. You, who've expended an 
inconceivable flow of energy, have been called a parasite. You, who've 
created abundance where there had been nothing but wastelands and helpless, 
starving men before you, have been called a robber. You, who've kept them all 
alive, have been called an exploiter. You, the purest and most moral man 
among them, have been sneered at as a 'vulgar materialist.' Have you stopped 
to ask them: by what right?— by what code?— by what standard? No, you have 
borne it all and kept silent. You bowed to their code and you never upheld 
your own. You knew what exacting morality was needed to produce a single 
metal nail, but you let them brand you as immoral. 

You knew that man needs the strictest code of values to deal with nature, 
but you thought that you needed no such code to deal with men. You left the 



deadliest weapon in the hands of your enemies, a weapon you never suspected 
or understood. Their moral code is their weapon. Ask yourself how deeply and 
in how many terrible ways you have accepted it. Ask yourself what it is that 
a code of moral values does to a man's life, and why he can't exist without 
it, and what happens to him if he accepts the wrong standard, by which the 
evil is the good. Shall I tell you why you're drawn to me, even though you 
think you ought to damn me? It's because I'm the first man who has given you 
what the whole world owes you and what you should have demanded of all men 
before you dealt with them: a moral sanction." 

Rearden whirled to him, then remained still, with a stillness like a gasp. 
Francisco leaned forward, as if he were reaching the landing of a dangerous 
flight, and his eyes were steady, but their glance seemed to tremble with 
intensity . 

"You're guilty of a great sin, Mr. Rearden, much guiltier than they tell 
you, but not in the way they preach. The worst guilt is to accept an 
undeserved guilt— and that is what you have been doing all your life. 

You have been paying blackmail, not for your vices, but for your virtues. 
You have been willing to carry the load of an unearned punishment— and toilet 
it grow the heavier the greater the virtues you practiced. But your virtues 
were those which keep men alive. Your own moral code— the one you lived by, 
but never stated, acknowledged or defended— was the code that preserves man's 
existence. If you were punished for it, what was the nature of those who 
punished you? 

Yours was the code of life. What, then, is theirs? What standard of value 
lies at its root? What is its ultimate purpose? Do you think that what you're 
facing is merely a conspiracy to seize your wealth? You, who know the source 
of wealth, should know it's much more and much worse than that. Did you ask 
me to name man's motive power? 

Man's motive power is his moral code. Ask yourself where their code is 
leading you and what it offers you as your final goal. A viler evil than to 
murder a man, is to sell him suicide as an act of virtue. A viler evil than 
to throw a man into a sacrificial furnace, is to demand that he leap in, of 
his own will, and that he build the furnace, besides. By their own statement, 
it is they who need you and have nothing to offer you in return. By their own 
statement, you must support them because they cannot survive without you. 
Consider the obscenity of offering their impotence and their need— their need 
of you— as a justification for your torture. Are you willing to accept it? Do 
you care to purchase— at the price of your great endurance, at the price of 
your agony— the satisfaction of the needs of your own destroyers?" 

"No ! " 

"Mr. Rearden," said Francisco, his voice solemnly calm, "if you saw Atlas, 
the giant who holds the world on his shoulders, if you saw that he stood, 
blood running down his chest, his knees buckling, his arms trembling but 
still trying to hold the world aloft with the last of his strength, and the 
greater his effort the heavier the world bore down upon his shoulders— what 
would you tell him to do?" 

"I . . . don't know. What . . . could he do? What would you tell him?" 

"To shrug." 

The clatter of the metal came in a flow of irregular sounds without 
discernible rhythm, not like the action of a mechanism, but as if some 
conscious impulse were behind every sudden, tearing rise that went up and 
crashed, scattering into the faint moan of gears. The glass of the windows 
tinkled once in a while. 

Francisco's eyes were watching Rearden as if he were examining the course 
of bullets on a battered target. The course was hard to trace: the gaunt 
figure on the edge of the desk was erect, the cold blue eyes showed nothing 



but the intensity of a glance fixed upon a great distance, only the 
inflexible mouth betrayed a line drawn by pain. 

"Go on," said Rearden with effort, "continue. You haven't finished, have 
you?" 

"I have barely begun." Francisco's voice was hard. 
"What . . . are you driving at?" 

"You'll know it before I'm through. But first, I want you to answer a 
question: if you understand the nature of your burden, how can you . . ." 

The scream of an alarm siren shattered the space beyond the window and 
shot like a rocket in a long, thin line to the sky. It held for an instant, 
then fell, then went on in rising, falling spirals of sound, as if fighting 
for breath against terror to scream louder. It was the shriek of agony, the 
call for help, the voice of the mills as of a wounded body crying to hold its 
soul . 

Rearden thought that he leaped for the door the instant the scream hit his 
consciousness, but he saw that he was an instant late, because Francisco had 
preceded him. Flung by the blast of the same response as his own, Francisco 
was flying down the hall, pressing the button of the elevator and, not 
waiting, racing on down the stairs. Rearden followed him and, watching the 
dial of the elevator on the stair landings, they met it halfway down the 
height of the building. Before the steel cage had ceased trembling at the 
sill of the ground floor, Francisco was out, racing to meet the sound of the 
call for help. Rearden had thought himself a good runner, but he could not 
keep up with the swift figure streaking off through stretches of red glare 
and darkness, the figure of a useless playboy he had hated himself for 
admiring . 

The stream, gushing from a hole low on the side of a blast furnace, did 
not have the red glow of fire, but the white radiance of sunlight. 

It poured along the ground, branching off at random in sudden streaks; it 
cut through a dank fog of steam with a bright suggestion of morning. 

It was liquid iron, and what the scream of the alarm proclaimed was a 
break-out . 

The charge of the furnace had been hung up and, breaking, had blown the 
tap-hole open. The furnace foreman lay knocked unconscious, the white flow 
spurted, slowly tearing the hole wider, and men were struggling with sand, 
hose and fire clay to stop the glowing streaks that spread in a heavy, 
gliding motion, eating everything on their way into jets of acrid smoke. 

In the few moments which Rearden needed to grasp the sight and nature of 
the disaster, he saw a man's figure rising suddenly at the foot of the 
furnace, a figure outlined by the red glare almost as if it stood in the path 
of the torrent, he saw the swing of a white shirt sleeved arm that rose and 
flung a black object into the source of the spurting metal. It was Francisco 
d'Anconia, and his action belonged to an art which Rearden had not believed 
any man to be trained to perform any longer. 

Years before, Rearden had worked in an obscure steel plant in Minnesota, 
where it had been his job, after a blast furnace was tapped, to close the 
hole by hand— by throwing bullets of fire clay to dam the flow of the metal. 
It was a dangerous job that had taken many lives; it had been abolished years 
earlier by the invention of the hydraulic gun; but there had been struggling, 
failing mills which, on their way down, had attempted to use the outworn 
equipment and methods of a distant past. Rearden had done the job; but in the 
years since, he had met no other man able to do it. In the midst of shooting 
jets of live steam, in the face of a crumbling blast furnace, he was now 
seeing the tall, slim figure of the playboy performing the task with the 
skill of an expert. 

It took an instant for Rearden to tear off his coat, seize a pair of 
goggles from the first man in sight and join Francisco at the mouth of the 



furnace. There was no time to speak, to feel or to wonder. Francisco glanced 
at him once— and what Rearden saw was a smudged face, black goggles and a wide 
grin . 

They stood on a slippery bank of baked mud, at the edge of the white 
stream, with the raging hole under their feet, flinging clay into the glare 
where the twisting tongues that looked like gas were boiling metal. Rearden 's 
consciousness became a progression of bending, raising the weight, aiming and 
sending it down and, before it had reached its unseen destination, bending 
for the next one again, a consciousness drawn tight upon watching the aim of 
his arm, to save the furnace, and the precarious posture of his feet, to save 
himself. He was aware of nothing else— except that the sum of it was the 
exultant feeling of action, of his own capacity, of his body's precision, of 
its response to his will. And with no time to know it, but knowing it, 
seizing it with his senses past the censorship of his mind, he was seeing a 
black silhouette with red rays shooting from behind its shoulders, its 
elbows, its angular curves, the red rays circling through steam like the long 
needles of spotlights, following the movements of a swift, expert, confident 
being whom he had never seen before except in evening clothes under the 
lights of ballrooms. 

There was no time to form words, to think, to explain, but he knew that 
this was the real Francisco d'Anconia, this was what he had seen from the 
first and loved— the word did not shock him, because there was no word in his 
mind, there was only a joyous feeling that seemed like a flow of energy added 
to his own. 

To the rhythm of his body, with the scorching heat on his face and the 
winter night on his shoulder blades, he was seeing suddenly that this was the 
simple essence of his universe: the instantaneous refusal to submit to 
disaster, the irresistible drive to fight it, the triumphant feeling of his 
own ability to win. He was certain that Francisco felt it, too, that he had 
been moved by the same impulse, that it was right to feel it, right for both 
of them to be what they were— he caught glimpses of a sweat-streaked face 
intent upon action, and it was the most joyous face he had ever seen. 

The furnace stood above them, a black bulk wrapped in coils of tubes and 
steam; she seemed to pant, shooting red gasps that hung on the air above the 
mills— and they fought not to let her bleed to death. 

Sparks hung about their feet and burst in sudden sheafs out of the metal, 
dying unnoticed against their clothes, against the skin of their hands. The 
stream was coming slower, in broken spurts through the dam rising beyond 
their sight. 

It happened so fast that Rearden knew it fully only after it was over. 

He knew that there were two moments: the first was when he saw the violent 
swing of Francisco's body in a forward thrust that sent the bullet to 
continue the line in space, then he saw the sudden, unrhythmic jerk backward 
that did not succeed, the convulsive beating against a forward pull, the 
extended arms of the silhouette losing its balance, he thought that a leap 
across the distance between them on the slippery, crumbling ridge would mean 
the death of both of them— and the second moment was when he landed at 
Francisco's side, held him in his arms, hung swaying together between space 
and ridge, over the white pit, then gained his footing and pulled him back, 
and, for an instant, still held the length of Francisco's body against the 
length of his own, as he would have held the body of an only son. His love, 
his terror, his relief were in a single sentence: "Be careful, you goddamn 
fool ! " 

Francisco reached for a chunk of clay and went on. 

When the job was done and the gap was closed, Rearden noticed that there 
was a twisting pain in the muscles of his arms and legs, that his body had no 



strength left to move— yet that he felt as if he were entering his office in 
the morning, eager for ten new problems to solve. 

He looked at Francisco and noticed for the first time that their clothes 
had blade-ringed holes, that their hands were bleeding, that there was a 
patch of skin torn on Francisco's temple and a red thread winding down his 
cheekbone. Francisco pushed the goggles back off his eyes and grinned at him: 
it was a smile of morning. 

A young man with a look of chronic hurt and impertinence together, rushed 
up to him, crying, "I couldn't help it, Mr. Rearden!" 

and launched into a speech of explanation. Rearden turned his back on him 
without a word. It was the assistant in charge of the pressure gauge of the 
furnace, a young man out of college. 

Somewhere on the outer edge of Rearden ' s consciousness, there was the 
thought that accidents of this nature were happening more frequently now, 
caused by the kind of ore he was using, but he had to use whatever ore he 
could find. There was the thought that his old workers had always been able 
to avert disaster; any of them would have seen e indications of a hang-up and 
known how to prevent it; but there were not many of them left, and he had to 
employ whatever men he could find. Through the swirling coils of steam around 
him, he observed that it was the older men who had rushed from all over the 
mills to fight the break-out and now stood in line, being given first aid by 
the medical staff. He wondered what was happening to the young men of the 
country. But the wonder was swallowed by the sight of the college boy's face, 
which he could not bear to see, by a wave of contempt, by the wordless 
thought that if this was the enemy, there was nothing to fear. All these 
things came to him and vanished in the outer darkness; the sight blotting 
them out was Francisco d'Anconia, He saw Francisco giving orders to the men 
around him. They did not know who he was or where he came from, but they 
listened: they knew he was a man who knew his job. Francisco broke off in the 
middle of a sentence, seeing Rearden approach and listen, and said, laughing, 
"Oh, I beg your pardon!" Rearden said, "Go right ahead. It's all correct, so 
far. " 

They said nothing to each other when they walked together through the 
darkness, on their way back to the office. Rearden felt an exultant laughter 
swelling within him, he felt that he wanted, in his turn, to wink at 
Francisco like a fellow conspirator who had learned a secret Francisco would 
not acknowledge. He glanced at his face once in a while, but Francisco would 
not look at him. 

After a while, Francisco said, "You saved my Me." The "thank you" 

was in the way he said it. 

Rearden chuckled. "You saved my furnace." 

They went on in silence. Rearden felt himself growing lighter with every 
step. Raising his face to the cold air, he saw the peaceful darkness bf the 
sky and a single star above a smokestack with the vertical lettering: Rearden 
Steel. He felt how glad he was to be alive. 

He did not expect the change he saw in Francisco's face when he looked at 
it in the light of his office. The things he had seen by the glare of the 
furnace were gone. He had expected a look of triumph, of mockery at all the 
insults Francisco had heard from him, a look demanding the apology he was 
joyously eager to offer. Instead, he saw a face made lifeless by an odd 
dejection. 

"Are you hurt?" 

"No . . . no, not at all." 

"Come here, " ordered Rearden, opening the door of his bathroom. 
. "Look at yourself." 
"Never mind. You come here." 



For the first time, Rearden felt that he was the older man; he felt the 
pleasure of taking Francisco in charge; he felt a confident, amused, paternal 
protectiveness . He washed the grime off Francisco's face, he put 
disinfectants and adhesive bandages on his temple, his hands, his scorched 
elbows. Francisco obeyed him in silence. 

Rearden asked, in the tone of the most eloquent salute he could offer, 
"Where did you learn to work like that?" 

Francisco shrugged. "I was brought up around smelters of every kind," he 
answered indifferently. 

Rearden could not decipher the expression of his face: it was only a look 
of peculiar stillness, as if his eyes were fixed on some secret vision of his 
own that drew his mouth into a line of desolate, bitter, hurting self- 
mockery . 

They did not speak until they were back in the office. 

"You know," said Rearden, "everything you said here was true. But that was 
only part of the story. The other part is what we've done tonight. Don't you 
see? We're able to act. They're not. So it's we who'll win in the long run, 
no matter what they do to us." 

Francisco did not answer, "Listen," said Rearden, "I know what's been the 
trouble with you. 

You've never cared to do a real day's work in your life. I thought you 
were conceited enough, but I see that you have no idea of what you've got in 
you. Forget that fortune of yours for a while and come to work for me. I'll 
start you as furnace foreman any time. You don't know what it will do for 
you. In a few years, you'll be ready to appreciate and to run d'Anconia 
Copper . " 

He expected a burst of laughter and he was prepared to argue; instead, he 
saw Francisco shaking his head slowly, as if he could not trust his voice, as 
if he feared that were he to speak, he would accept. 

In a moment, he said, "Mr. Rearden ... I think I would give the rest of 
my life for one year as your furnace foreman. But I can't." 

"Why not?" 

"Don't ask me. It's ... a personal matter." 

The vision of Francisco in Rearden 's mind, which he had resented and found 
irresistibly attractive, had been the figure of a man radiantly incapable of 
suffering. What he saw now in Francisco's eyes was the look of a quiet, 
tightly controlled, patiently borne torture. 

Francisco reached silently for his overcoat. 

"You're not leaving, are you?" asked Rearden, "Yes." 

"Aren't you going to finish what you had to tell me?" 

"Not tonight." 

"You wanted me to answer a question. What was it?" 
Francisco shook his head. 

"You started asking me how can I . . . How can I— what?" 

Francisco's smile was like a moan of pain, the only moan he would permit 
himself. "I won't ask it, Mr. Rearden. I know it." 



CHAPTER IV 
THE SANCTION OF THE VICTIM 



The roast turkey had cost $30. The champagne had cost $25. The lace 
tablecloth, a cobweb of grapes and vine leaves iridescent in the candlelight, 
had cost $2,000. The dinner service, with an artist's design burned in blue 
and gold into a translucent white china, had cost $2,500. 

The silverware, which bore the initials LR in Empire wreaths of laurels, 
had cost $3,000. But it was held to be unspiritual to think of money and of 
what that money represented. 

A peasant's wooden shoe, gilded, stood in the center of the table, filled 
with marigolds, grapes and carrots. The candles were stuck into pumpkins that 
were cut as open-mouthed faces drooling raisins, nuts and candy upon the 
tablecloth . 

It was Thanksgiving dinner, and the three who faced Rearden about the 
table were his wife, his mother and his brother. 

"This is the night to thank the Lord for our blessings," said Rearden 's 
mother. "God has been kind to us. There are people all over the country who 
haven't got any food in the house tonight, and some that haven't even got a 
house, and more of them going jobless every day. 

Gives me the creeps to look around in the city. Why, only last week, who 
do you suppose I ran into but Lucie Judson— Henry, do you remember Lucie 
Judson? Used to live next door to us. up in Minnesota, when you were ten- 
twelve years old. Had a boy about your age. I lost track of Lucie when they 
moved to New York, must have been all of twenty years ago. Well, it gave me 
the creeps to see what she's come to— just a toothless old hag, wrapped in a 
man's overcoat, panhandling on a street corner. And I thought: That could ' ve 
been me, but for the grace of God." 

"Well, if thanks are in order," said Lillian gaily, "I think that we 
shouldn't forget Gertrude, the new cook. She's an artist." 

"Me, I'm just going to be old-fashioned," said Philip. "I'm just going to 
thank the sweetest mother in the world." 

"Well, for the matter of that," said Rearden 's mother, "we ought to . 
thank Lillian for this dinner and for all the trouble she took to make it so 
pretty. She spent hours fixing the table. It's real quaint and different." 

"It's the wooden shoe that does it," said Philip, bending his head 
sidewise to study it in a manner of critical appreciation. "That's the real 
touch. Anybody can have candles, silverware and junk, that doesn't take 
anything but money— but this shoe, that took thought." 

Rearden said nothing. The candlelight moved over his motionless face as 
over a portrait; the portrait bore an expression of impersonal courtesy. 

"You haven't touched your wine," said his mother, looking at him. 

"What I think is you ought to drink a toast in gratitude to the people of 
this country who have given you so much." 

"Henry is not in the mood for it, Mother," said Lillian. "I'm afraid 
Thanksgiving is a holiday only for those who have a clear conscience." 

She raised her wine glass, but stopped it halfway to her lips and asked, 
"You're not going to make some sort of stand at your trial tomorrow, are you, 
Henry?" 

"I am." 

She put the glass down. "What are you going to do?" 
"You'll see it tomorrow." 

"You don't really imagine that you can get away with it!" 

"I don't know what you have in mind as the object I'm to get away with." 

"Do you realize that the charge against you is extremely serious?" 

"I do." 



"You've admitted that you sold the Metal to Ken Danagger." 
"I have." 

"They might send you to jail for ten years," 
"I don't think they will, but it's possible." 

"Have you been reading the newspapers, Henry?" asked Philip, with an odd 
kind of smile. 
"No . " 

"Oh, you should! " 
"Should I? Why?" 

"You ought to see the names they call you!" 

"That's interesting," said Rearden; he said it about the fact that 
Philip's smile was one of pleasure. 

"I don't understand it," said his mother. "Jail? Did you say jail, 
Lillian? Henry, are you going to be sent to jail?" 

"I might be." 

"But that's ridiculous' Do something about it." 
"What?" 

"I don't know. I don't understand any of it. Respectable people don't go 
to jail. Do something. You've always known what to do about business." 
"Not this kind of business." 

"I don't believe it." Her voice had the tone of a frightened, spoiled 
child. "You're saying it just to be mean." 

"He's playing the hero, Mother," said Lillian. She smiled coldly, turning 
to Rearden. "Don't you think that your attitude is perfectly futile?" 

"No . " 

"You know that cases of this kind are not . . . intended ever to come to 
trial. There are ways to avoid it, to get things settled amicably —if one 
knows the right people." 

"I don't know the right people." 

"Look at Orren Boyle. He's done much more and much worse than your little 
fling at the black market, but he's smart enough to keep himself out of 
courtrooms . " 

"Then I'm not smart enough." 

"Don't you think it's time you made an effort to adjust yourself to the 
conditions of our age?" 
"No. " 

"Well, then I don't see how you can pretend that you're some sort of 
victim. If you go to jail, it will be your own fault." 
"What pretense are you talking about, Lillian?" 

"Oh, I know that you think you're fighting for some sort of principle —but 
actually it's only a matter of your incredible conceit. You're doing it for 
no better reason than because you think you're right." 

"Do you think they're right?" 

She shrugged, "That's the conceit I'm talking about— the idea that it 
matters who's right or wrong. It's the most insufferable form of vanity, this 
insistence on always doing right. How do you know what's right? 

How can anyone ever know it? It's nothing but a delusion to flatter your 
own ego and to hurt other people by flaunting your superiority over them." 

He was looking at her with attentive interest. "Why should it hurt other 
people, if it's nothing but a delusion?" 

"Is it necessary for me to point out that in your case it's nothing but 
hypocrisy? That is why I find your attitude preposterous. Questions of right 
have no bearing on human existence. And you're certainly nothing but human— 
aren't you, Henry? You're no better than any of the men you're going to face 
tomorrow. I think you should remember that it's not for you to make a stand 
on any sort of principle. Maybe you're a victim in this particular mess, 
maybe they're pulling a rotten trick on you, but what of it? They're doing it 



because they're weak; they couldn't resist the temptation to grab your Metal 
and to muscle in on your profits, because they had no other way of ever 
getting rich. Why should you blame them? It's only a question of different 
strains, but it s the same shoddy human fabric that gives way just as 
quickly. You wouldn't be tempted by money, because it's so easy for you to 
make it. 

But you wouldn't withstand other pressures and you'd fall just as 
ignominiously . Wouldn't you? So you have no right to any righteous 
indignation against them. You have no moral superiority to assert or to 
defend. And if you haven't, then what is the point of fighting a battle that 
you can't win? I suppose that one might find some satisfaction in being a 
martyr, if one is above reproach. But you— who are you to cast the first 
stone?" 

She paused to observe the effect. There was none, except that his look of 
attentive interest seemed intensified; he listened as if he were held by some 
impersonal, scientific curiosity. It was not the response she had expected. 

"1 believe you understand me," she said. 

"No," he answered quietly, "I don't." 

"I think you should abandon the illusion of your own perfection, which you 
know full well to be an illusion. I think you should learn to get along with 
other people. The day of the hero is past. This is the day of humanity, in a 
much deeper sense than you imagine. Human beings are no longer expected to be 
saints nor to be punished for their sins. Nobody is right or wrong, we're all 
in it together, we're all human— and the human is the imperfect. You'll gain 
nothing tomorrow by proving that they're wrong. You ought to give in with 
good grace, simply because it's the practical thing to do. You ought to keep 
silent, precisely because they're wrong. They'll appreciate it. Make 
concessions for others and they'll make concessions for you. Live and let 
live. Give and take. Give in and take in. That's the policy of our age— and 
it's time you accepted it. Don't tell me you're too good for it. You know 
that you're not. You know that I know it." 

The look of his eyes, held raptly still upon some point in space, was not 
in answer to her words; it was in answer to a man's voice saying to him, "Do 
you think that what you're facing is merely a conspiracy to seize your 
wealth? You, who know the source of wealth, should know it's much more and 
much worse than that." 

He turned to look at Lillian. He was seeing the full extent of her 
failure— in the immensity of his own indifference. The droning stream of her 
insults was like the sound of a distant riveting machine, a long, impotent 
pressure that reached nothing within him. He had heard her studied reminders 
of his guilt on every evening he had spent at home in the past three months. 
But guilt had been the one emotion he had found himself unable to feel. The 
punishment she had wanted to inflict on him was the torture of shame; what 
she had inflicted was the torture of boredom. 

He remembered his brief glimpse— on that morning in the Wayne Falkland 
Hotel— of a flaw in her scheme of punishment, which he had not examined. Now 
he stated it to himself for the first time. She wanted to force upon him the 
suffering of dishonor— but his own sense of honor was her only weapon of 
enforcement. She wanted to wrest from him an acknowledgment of his moral 
depravity— but only his own moral rectitude could attach significance to such 
a verdict. She wanted to injure him by her contempt— but he could not be 
injured, unless he respected her judgment. She wanted to punish him for the 
pain he had caused her and she held her pain as a gun aimed at him, as if she 
wished to extort his agony at the point of his pity. But her only tool was 
his own benevolence, his concern for her, his compassion. Her only power was 
the power of his own virtues. What if he chose to withdraw it? 



An issue of guilt, he thought, had to rest on his own acceptance of the 
code of justice that pronounced him guilty. He did not accept it; he never 
had. His virtues, all the virtues she needed to achieve his punishment, came 
from another code and lived by another standard. 

He felt no guilt, no shame, no regret, no dishonor. He felt no concern for 
any verdict she chose to pass upon him: he had lost respect for her judgment 
long ago. And the sole chain still holding him was only a last remnant of 
pity. 

But what was the code on which she acted? What sort of code permitted the 
concept of a punishment that required the victim's own virtue as the fuel to 
make it work? A code— he thought— which would destroy only those who tried to 
observe it; a punishment, from which only the honest would suffer, while the 
dishonest would escape unhurt. Could one conceive of an infamy lower than to 
equate virtue with pain, to make virtue, not vice, the source and motive 
power of suffering? If he were the kind of rotter she was struggling to make 
him believe he was, then no issue of his honor and his moral worth would 
matter to him. If he wasn't, then what was the nature of her attempt? 

To count upon his virtue and use it as an instrument of torture, to 
practice blackmail with the victim's generosity as sole means of extortion, 
to accept the gift of a man's good will and turn it into a tool for the 
giver's destruction ... he sat very still, contemplating the formula of so 
monstrous an evil that he was able to name it, but not to believe it 
possible . 

He sat very still, held by the hammering of a single question: Did Lillian 
know the exact nature of her scheme?— was it a conscious policy, devised with 
full awareness of its meaning? He shuddered; he did not hate her enough to 
believe it. 

He looked at her. She was absorbed, at the moment, in the task of cutting 
a plum pudding that stood as a mount of blue flame on a silver platter before 
her, its glow dancing over her face and her laughing mouth— she was plunging a 
silver knife into the flame, with a practiced, graceful curve of her arm. She 
had metallic leaves in the red, gold and brown colors of autumn scattered 
over one shoulder of her black velvet gown; they glittered in the 
candlelight . 

He could not get rid of the impression, which he had kept receiving and 
rejecting for three months, that her vengeance was not a form of despair, as 
he had supposed— the impression, which he regarded as inconceivable, that she 
was enjoying it. He could find no trace of pain in her manner. She had an air 
of confidence new to her. She seemed to be at home in her house for the first 
time. Even though everything within the house was of her own choice and 
taste, she had always seemed to act as the bright, efficient, resentful 
manager of a high-class hotel, who keeps smiling in bitter amusement at her 
position of inferiority to the owners. The amusement remained, but the 
bitterness was gone. She had not gained weight, but her features had lost 
their delicate sharpness in a blurring, softening look of satisfaction; even 
her voice sounded as if it had grown plump. 

He did not hear what she was saying; she was laughing in the last flicker 
of the blue flames, while he sat weighing the question: Did she know? He felt 
certain that he had discovered a secret much greater than the problem of his 
marriage, that he had grasped the formula of a policy practiced more widely 
throughout the world than he dared to contemplate at the moment. But to 
convict a human being of that practice was a verdict of irrevocable 
damnation, and he knew that he would not believe it of anyone, so long as the 
possibility of a doubt remained. 

No— he thought, looking at Lillian, with the last effort of his generosity- 
he would not believe it of her. In the name of whatever grace and pride she 
possessed— in the name of such moments when he had seen a smile of joy on her 



face, the smile of a living being— in the name of the brief shadow of love he 
had once felt for her— he would not pronounce upon her a verdict of total 
evil . 

The butter slipped a plate of plum pudding in front of him, and he heard 
Lillian's voice: "Where have you been for the last five minutes, Henry— or is 
it for the last century? You haven't answered me. You haven't heard a word I 
said. " 

"I heard it," he answered quietly. "I don't know what you're trying to 
accomplish . " 

"What a question!" said his mother. "Isn't that just like a man? 
She's trying to save you from going to jail— that's what she's trying to 
accomplish . " 

That could be true, he thought; perhaps, by the reasoning of some crude, 
childish cowardice, the motive of their malice was a desire to protect him, 
to break him down into the safety of a compromise. It's possible, he thought— 
but knew that he did not believe it. 

"You've always been unpopular," said Lillian, "and it's more than a matter 
of any one particular issue. It's that unyielding, intractable attitude of 
yours. The men who ' re going to try you, know what you're thinking. That's why 
they'll crack down on you, while they'd let another man off." 

"Why, no. I don't think they know what I'm thinking. That's what I have to 
let them know tomorrow." 

"Unless you show them that you're willing to give in and co-operate, you 
won't have a chance. You've been too hard to deal with." 

"No. I've been too easy." 

"But if they put you in jail," said his mother, "what's going to happen to 
your family? Have you thought of that?" 
"No. I haven't." 

"Have you thought of the disgrace you'll bring upon us?" 
"Mother, do you understand the issue in this case?" 

"No, I don't and I-don't want to understand. It's all dirty business and 
dirty politics. All business is just dirty politics and all politics is just 
dirty business. I never did want to understand any of it. I don't care who's 
right or wrong, but what I think a man ought to think of first is his family. 
Don't you know what this will do to us?" 

"No, Mother, I don't know or care." 

His mother looked at him, aghast. 

"Well, I think you have a very provincial attitude, all of you," said 
Philip suddenly. "Nobody here seems to be concerned with the wider, social 
aspects of the case. I don't agree with you, Lillian. I don't see why you say 
that they're pulling some sort of rotten trick on Henry and that he's in the 
right. I think he's guilty as hell. Mother, I can explain the issue to you 
very simply. There's nothing unusual about it, the courts are full of cases 
of this kind. Businessmen are taking advantage of the national emergency in 
order to make money. They break the regulations which protect the common 
welfare of all— for the sake of their own personal gain. They're profiteers of 
the black market who grow rich by defrauding the poor of their rightful 
share, at a time of desperate shortage. They pursue a ruthless, grasping, 
grabbing, antisocial policy, based on nothing but plain, selfish greed. It's 
no use pretending about it, we all know it— and I think it's contemptible." 

He spoke in a careless, offhand manner, as if explaining the obvious to a 
group of adolescents; his tone conveyed the assurance of a man who knows that 
the moral ground of his stand is not open to question. 

Rearden sat looking at him, as if studying an object seen for the first 
time. Somewhere deep in Rearden 's mind, as a steady, gentle, inexorable beat, 
was a man's voice, saying: By what right?— by what code?— 

by what standard? 



"Philip," he said, not raising his voice, "say any of that again and you 
will find yourself out in the street, right now, with the suit you've got on 
your back, with whatever change you've got in your pocket and with nothing 
else . " 

. He heard no answer, no sound, no movement. He noted that the stillness 
of the three before him had no element of astonishment. The look of shock on 
their faces was not the shock of people at the sudden explosion of a bomb, 
but the shock of people who had known that they Were playing with a lighted 
fuse. There were no outcries, no protests, no questions; they knew that he 
meant it and they knew everything it meant. A dim, sickening feeling told him 
that they had known it long before he did. 

"You . . . you wouldn't throw your own brother out on the street, would 
you?" his mother said at last; it was not a demand, but a plea. 

"I would." 

"But he's your brother . . . Doesn't that mean anything to you?" 
"No . " 

"Maybe he goes a bit too far at times, but it's just loose talk, it's just 
that modern jabber, he doesn't know what he's saying." 
"Then let him learn." 

"Don't be hard on him . . .he's younger than you and . . . and weaker. He 
. . . Henry, don't look at me that way! I've never seen you look like that. . 
. . You shouldn't frighten him. You know that he needs you." 

"Does he know it?" 

"You can't be hard on a man who needs you, it will prey on your conscience 
for the rest of your life." 
"It won't." 

"You've got to be kind, Henry." 
"I'm not. " 

"You've got to have some pity." 
"I haven't." 

"A good man knows how to forgive." 
"I don't." 

"You wouldn't want me to think that you're selfish," 
"I am." 

Philip's eyes were darting from one to the other. He looked like a man who 
had felt certain that he stood on solid granite and had suddenly discovered 
that it was thin ice, now cracking open all around him. 

"But I . . . " he tried, and stopped; his voice sounded like steps testing 
the ice. "But don't I have any freedom of speech?" 

"In your own house. Not in mine." 

"Don't I have a right to my own ideas?" 

"At your own expense. Not at mine." 

"Don't you tolerate any differences of opinion?" 

"Not when I'm paying the bills." 

"Isn't there anything involved but money?" 

"Yes. The fact that it's my money." 

"Don't you want to consider any hi . . ."—he was going to say "higher," 
but changed his mind— "any other aspects?" 
"No . " 

"But I'm not your slave." 
"Am I yours?" 

"I don't know what you—" He stopped; he knew what was meant. 
"No," said Rearden, "you're not my slave. You're free to walk out of here 
any time you choose." 

"I . . .I'm not speaking of that." 
"I am." 

"I don't understand it . . ." 



my political views. You've never "Don't you?" 
"You've always known my . 
objected before." 

"That's true," said Rearden gravely. "Perhaps I owe you an explanation, if 
I have misled you. I've tried never to remind you that you're riving on my 
charity. I thought that it was your place to remember it. 

I thought that any human being who accepts the help of another, knows that 
good will is the giver's only motive and that good will is the payment he 
owes in return. But I see that I was wrong. You were getting your food 
unearned and you concluded that affection did not have to be earned, either. 
You concluded that I was the safest person in the world for you to spit on, 
precisely because I held you by the throat. You concluded that I wouldn't 
want to remind you of it and that I would be tied by the fear of hurting your 
feelings. All right, let's get it straight: you're an object of charity who's 
exhausted his credit long ago. 

Whatever affection I might have felt for you once, is gone. I haven't the 
slightest interest in you, your fate or your future. I haven't any reason 
whatever for wishing to feed you. If you leave my house, it won't make any 
difference to me whether you starve or not. Now that is your position here 
and I will expect you to remember it, if you wish to stay. If not, then get 
out . " 

But for the movement of drawing his head a little into his shoulders, 
Philip showed no reaction. "Don't imagine that I enjoy living here," he said; 
his voice was lifeless and shrill. "If you think I'm happy, you're mistaken. 
I'd give anything to get away." The words pertained to defiance, but the 
voice had a curiously cautious quality. "If that is how you feel about it, it 
would be best for me to leave." The words were a statement, but the voice put 
a question mark at the end of it and waited; there was no answer. "You 
needn't worry about my future. I don't have to ask: favors of anybody. I can 
take care of myself all right." The words were addressed to Rearden, but the 
eyes were looking at his mother; she did not speak; she was afraid to move. 
"I've always wanted to be on my own. I've always wanted to live in New York, 
near all my friends." The voice slowed down and added in an impersonal, 
reflective manner, as if the words were not addressed to anyone, "Of course, 
I'd have the problem of maintaining a certain social position . . . it's not 
my fault if I'll be embarrassed by a family name associated with a 
millionaire. ... I would need enough money for a year or two ... to 
establish myself in a manner suitable to my—" 

"You won't get it from me." 

"I wasn't asking you for it, was 1? Don't imagine that I couldn't get it 
somewhere else, if I wanted to! Don't imagine that I couldn't leave! 

I'd go in a minute, if I had only myself to think about. But Mother needs 
me, and if I deserted her—" 

"Don't explain." 

"And besides, you misunderstood me, Henry. I haven't said anything to 
insult you. I wasn't speaking in any personal way. I was only discussing the 
general political picture from an abstract sociological viewpoint which—" 

"Don't explain," said Rearden. He was looking at Philip's face. It was 
half-lowered, its eyes looking up at him. The eyes were lifeless, as if they 
had witnessed nothing; they held no spark of excitement, no personal 
sensation, neither of defiance nor of regret, neither of shame nor of 
suffering; they were filmy ovals that held no response to reality, no attempt 
to understand it, to weigh it, to reach some verdict of justice —ovals that 
held nothing but a dull, still, mindless hatred. "Don't explain. Just keep 
your mouth shut." 

The revulsion that made Rearden turn his face away contained a spasm of 
pity. There was an instant when he wanted to seize his brother's shoulders, 



to shake him, to cry: How could you do this to yourself? How did you come to 
a stage where this is all that's left of you? Why did you let the wonderful 
fact of your own existence go by? 

. . . He looked away. He knew it was useless. 

He noted, in weary contempt, that the three at the table remained silent. 
Through all the years past, his consideration for them had brought him 
nothing but their maliciously righteous reproaches. Where was their 
righteousness now? Now was the time to stand on their code of justice— if 
justice had been any part of their code. Why didn't they throw at him all 
those accusations of cruelty and selfishness, which he had come to accept as 
the eternal chorus to his life? What had permitted them to do it for years? 
He knew that the words he heard in his mind were the key to the answer: The 
sanction of the victim. 

"Don't let's quarrel," said his mother, her voice cheerless and vague. 

"It's Thanksgiving Day." 

When he looked at Lillian, he caught a glance that made him certain she 
had watched him for a long time: its quality was panic. 

He got up. "You will please excuse me now," he said to the table at large. 
"Where are you going?" asked Lillian sharply. 

He stood looking at her for a deliberate moment, as if to confirm the 
meaning she would read in his answer: "To New York." 
She jumped to her feet. "Tonight?" 
"Now, " 

"You can't go to New York tonight!" Her voice was not loud, but it had the 
imperious helplessness of a shriek. "This is not the time when you can afford 
it. When you can afford to desert your family, I mean. 

You ought to think about the matter of clean hands. You're not in a 
position to permit yourself anything which you know to be depravity." 

By what code?— thought Rearden— by what standard? 

"Why do you wish to go to New York tonight?" 

"I think, Lillian, for the same reason that makes you wish to stop me." 
"Tomorrow is your trial." 
"That is what I mean." 

He made a movement to turn, and she raised her voice: "I don't want you to 
go!" He smiled. It was the first time he had smiled at her in the past three 
months; it was not the kind of smile she could care to see. "I forbid you to 
leave us tonight!" 

He turned and left the room. 

Sitting at the wheel of his car, with the glassy, frozen road flying at 
his face and down under the wheels at sixty miles an hour, he let the thought 
of his family drop away from him— and the vision of their faces went rolling 
back into the abyss of speed that swallowed the bare Trees and lonely 
structures of the roadside. There was little traffic, and few lights in the 
distant clusters of the towns he passed; the emptiness of inactivity was the 
only sign of a holiday. A hazy glow, rusted by frost, flashed above the roof 
of a factory once in a rare while, and a cold wind shrieked through the 
joints of his car, beating the canvas top against the metal frame. 

By some dim sense of contrast, which he did not define, the thought of his 
family was replaced by the thought of his encounter with the Wet Nurse, the 
Washington boy of his mills. 

At the time of his indictment, he had discovered that the boy had known 
about his deal with Danagger, yet had not reported it to anyone. 

"Why didn't you inform your friends about me?" he had asked. 

The boy had answered brusquely, not looking at him, "Didn't want to." 

"It was part of your job to watch precisely for things of that kind, 
wasn't it?" 

"Yeah. " 



"Besides, your friends would have been delighted to hear it." 
"I knew." 

"Didn't you know what a valuable piece of information it was and what a 
stupendous trade you could have pulled with those friends of yours in 
Washington whom you offered to me once— remember ?— the friends who always 
'occasion expenses'?" The boy had not answered. 

"It could have made your career at the very top level. Don't tell me that 
you didn't know it." 

"I knew it." 

"Then why didn't you make use of it?" 
"I didn't want to." 
"Why not?" 
"Don't know." 

The boy had stood, glumly avoiding Rearden's eyes, as if trying to avoid 
something incomprehensible within himself. Rearden had laughed. 

"Listen, Non-Absolute, you're playing with fire. Better go and murder 
somebody fast, before you let it get you— that reason that stopped you from 
turning informer— or else it will blast your career to hell." 

The boy had not answered. 

This morning, Rearden had gone to his office as usual, even though the 
rest of the office building was closed. At lunch time, he had stopped at the 
rolling mills and had been astonished to find the Wet Nurse standing there, 
alone in a corner, ignored by everybody, watching the work with an air of 
childish enjoyment. 

"What are you doing here today?" Rearden had asked. "Don't you know it's a 
holiday?" 

"Oh, I let the girls off, but I just came in to finish some business." 
"What business?" 

"Oh, letters and . . . Oh, hell, I signed three letters and sharpened my 
pencils, I know I didn't have to do it today, but I had nothing to do at home 
and ... I get lonesome away from this place." 

"Don't you have any family?" 

"No . . . not to speak of. What about you, Mr. Rearden? Don't you have 
any?" 

"I guess— not to speak of." 

"I like this place. I like to hang around. . . . You know, Mr. Rearden, 
what I studied to be was a metallurgist." 

Walking away, Rearden had turned to glance back and had caught the Wet 
Nurse looking after him as a boy would look at the hero of his childhood's 
favorite adventure story. God help the poor little bastard! 

—he had thought . 

God help them all— he thought, driving through the dark streets of a small 
town, borrowing, in contemptuous pity, the words of their belief which he had 
never shared. He saw newspapers displayed on metal stands, with the black 
letters of headlines screaming to empty corners: "Railroad Disaster." He had 
heard the news on the radio, that afternoon: there had been a wreck on the 
main line of Taggart Transcontinental, near Rockland, Wyoming; a split rail 
had sent a freight train crashing over the edge of a canyon. Wrecks on the 
Taggart main line were becoming more frequent— the track was wearing out— the 
track which, less than eighteen months ago, Dagny was planning to rebuild, 
promising him a journey from coast to coast on his own Metal. 

She had spent a year, picking worn rail from abandoned branches to patch 
the rail of the main line. She had spent months fighting the men of Jim's 
Board of Directors, who said that the national emergency was only temporary 
and a track that had lasted for ten years could well last for another winter, 
until spring, when conditions would improve, as Mr. Wesley Mouch had 
promised. Three weeks ago, she had made them authorize the purchase of sixty 



thousand tons of new rail; it could do no more than make a few patches across 
the continent in the worst divisions, but it was all she had been able to 
obtain from them. 

She had had to wrench the money out of men deaf with panic: the freight 
revenues were falling at such a rate that the men of the Board had begun to 
tremble, staring at Jim's idea of the most prosperous year in Taggart 
history. She had had to order steel rail, there was no hope of obtaining an 
"emergency need" permission to buy Rearden Metal and no time to beg for it. 

Rearden looked away from the headlines to the glow at the edge of the sky, 
which was the city of New York far ahead; his hands tightened on the wheel a 
little. 

It was half past nine when he reached the city. Dagny's apartment was 
dark, when he let himself in with his key. He picked up the telephone and 
called her office. Her own voice answered: "Taggart Transcontinental." 

"Don't you know it's a holiday?" he asked. 

"Hello, Hank. Railroads have no holidays. Where are you calling from?" 
"Your place . " 

"I'll be through in another half-hour." 

"It's all right. Stay there. I'll come for you." 

The anteroom of her office was dark, when he entered, except for the 
lighted glass cubbyhole of Eddie Willers. Eddie was closing his desk, getting 
ready to leave. He looked at Rearden, in puzzled astonishment. 

"Good evening, Eddie. What is it that keeps you people so busy— 

the Rockland wreck?" 

Eddie sighed. "Yes, Mr. Rearden." 

"That's what I want to see Dagny about— about your rail." 
"She's still here." 

He started toward her door, when Eddie called after him hesitantly, "Mr. 
Rearden . . . " 

He stopped. "Yes?" 

"I wanted to say . . . because tomorrow is your trial . . . and whatever 
they do to you is supposed to be in the name of all the people ... I just 
wanted to say that I . . . that it won't be in my name . . . 

even if there's nothing I can do about it, except to tell you . . . even 
if I know that that doesn't mean anything." 

"It means much more than you suspect. Perhaps more than any of us suspect. 
Thanks, Eddie." 

Dagny glanced up from her desk, when Rearden entered her office; he saw 
her watching him as he approached and he saw the look of weariness 
disappearing from her eyes. He sat down on the edge of the desk. She leaned 
back, brushing a strand of hair off her face, her shoulders relaxing under 
her thin white blouse. 

"Dagny, there's something I want to tell you about the rail that you 
ordered. I want you to know this tonight." 

She was watching him attentively; the expression of his face pulled hers 
into the same look of quietly solemn tension. 

"I am supposed to deliver to Taggart Transcontinental, on February 
'fifteenth, sixty thousand tons of rail, which is to give you three hundred 
miles of track. You will receive— for the same sum of money— eighty thousand 
tons of rail, which will give you five hundred miles of track. 

You know what material is cheaper and lighter than steel. Your rail will 
not be steel, it will be Rearden Metal. Don't argue, object or agree. 

I am not asking for your consent. You are not supposed to consent or to 
know anything about it. I am doing this and I alone will be responsible. 

We will work it so that those on your staff who'll know that you've 
ordered steel, won't know that you've received Rearden Metal, and those 
who'll know that you've received Rearden Metal, won't know that you had no 



permit to buy it. We will tangle the bookkeeping in such a way that if the 
thing should ever blow up, nobody will be able to pin anything on anybody, 
except on me. They might suspect that I bribed someone on your staff, or they 
might suspect that you were hi on it, but they won't be able to prove it. I 
want you to give me your word that you will never admit it, no matter what 
happens. It's my Metal, and if there are any chances to take, it's I who'll 
take them. I have been planning this from the day I received your order. I 
have ordered the copper for it, from a source which will not betray me. I did 
not intend to tell you about it till later, but I changed my mind. I want you 
to know it tonight— because I am going on trial tomorrow for the same kind of 
crime . " 

She had listened without moving. At his last sentence, he saw a faint 
contraction of her cheeks and lips; it was not quite a smile, but it gave him 
her whole answer: pain, admiration, understanding. 

Then he saw her eyes becoming softer, more painfully, dangerously alive— he 
took her wrist, as if the tight grasp of his fingers and the severity of his 
glance were to give her the support she needed— and he said sternly, "Don't 
thank me— this is not a favor— I am doing it in order to be able to bear my 
work, or else I'll break like Ken Danagger." 

She whispered, "AH right, Hank, I won't thank you," the tone of her voice 
and the look of her eyes making it a lie by the time it was uttered. 

He smiled. "Give me the word I asked." 

She inclined her head. "I give you my word." He released her wrist. 

She added, not raising her head, "The only thing I'll say is that if they 
sentence you to jail tomorrow, I'll quit— without waiting for any destroyer to 
prompt me . " 

"You won't. And I don't think they'll sentence me to jail. I think they'll 
let me off very lightly. I have a hypothesis about it— I'll explain it to you 
afterwards, when I've put it to the test." 

"What hypothesis?" 

"Who is John Gait?" He smiled, and stood up. "That's all. We won't talk 
any further about my trial, tonight. You don't happen to have anything to 
drink in your office, have you?" 

"No. But I think my traffic manager has some sort of a bar on one shelf of 
his filing closet." 

"Do you think you could steal a drink for me, if he doesn't have it 
locked?" 

"I'll try." 

He stood looking at the portrait of Nat Taggart on the wall of her office— 
the portrait of a young man with a lifted head— until she returned, bringing a 
bottle of brandy and two glasses. He filled the glasses in silence. 

"You know, Dagny, Thanksgiving was a holiday established by productive 
people to celebrate the success of their work." 

The movement of his arm, as he raised his glass, went from the portrait— to 
her— to himself— to the buildings of the city beyond the window. 

For a month in advance, the people who filled the courtroom had been told 
by the press that they would see the man who was a greedy enemy of society; 
but they had come to see the man who had invented Rearden Metal. 

He stood up, when the judges called upon him to do so. He wore a gray 
suit, he had pale blue eyes and blond hair; it was not the colors that made 
his figure seem icily implacable, it was the fact that the suit had an 
expensive simplicity seldom flaunted these days, that it belonged in the 
sternly luxurious office of a rich corporation, that his bearing came from a 
civilized era and clashed with the place around him. 

The crowd knew from the newspapers that he represented the evil of 
ruthless wealth; and— as they praised the virtue of chastity, then ran to see 
any movie that displayed a half-naked female on its posters— so they came to 



see him; evil, at least, did not have the stale hopelessness of a bromide 
which none believed and none dared to challenge. They looked at him without 
admiration— admiration was a feeling they had lost the capacity to experience, 
long ago; they looked with curiosity and with a dim sense of defiance against 
those who had told them that it was their duty to hate him. 

A few years ago, they would have jeered at his air of self-confident 
wealth. But today, there was a slate-gray sky in the windows of the 
courtroom, which promised the first snowstorm of a long, hard winter; the 
last of the country's oil was vanishing, and the coal mines were not able to 
keep up with the hysterical scramble for winter supplies. The crowd in the 
courtroom remembered that this was the case which had cost them the services 
of Ken Danagger. There were rumors that the output of the Danagger Coal 
Company had fallen perceptibly within one month; the newspapers said that it 
was merely a matter of readjustment while Danagger 's cousin was reorganizing 
the company he had taken over. Last week, the front pages had carried the 
story of a catastrophe on the site of a housing project under construction: 
defective steel girders had collapsed, killing four workmen; the newspapers 
had not mentioned, but the crowd knew, that the girders had come from Orren 
Boyle's Associated Steel. 

They sat in the courtroom in heavy silence and they looked at the tall, 
gray figure, not with hope— they were losing the capacity to hope —but with an 
impassive neutrality spiked by a faint question mark; the question mark was 
placed over all the pious slogans they had heard for years. 

The newspapers had snarled that the cause of the country's troubles, as 
this case demonstrated, was the selfish greed of rich industrialists; that it 
was men like Hank Rearden who were to blame for the shrinking diet, the 
falling temperature and the cracking roofs in the homes of the nation; that 
if it had not been for men who broke regulations and hampered the 
government's plans, prosperity would have been achieved long ago; and that a 
man like Hank Rearden was prompted by nothing but the profit motive. This 
last was stated without explanation or elaboration, as if the words "profit 
motive" were the self-evident brand of ultimate evil. 

The crowd remembered that these same newspapers, less than two years ago, 
had screamed that the production of Rearden Metal should be forbidden, 
because its producer was endangering people's lives for the sake of his 
greed; they remembered that the man in gray had ridden in the cab of the 
first engine to run over a track of his own Metal; and that he was now on 
trial for the greedy crime of withholding from the public a load of the Metal 
which it had been his greedy crime to offer in the public market. 

According to the procedure established by directives, cases of this kind 
were not tried by a jury, but by a panel of three judges appointed by the 
Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources; the procedure, the 
directives had stated, was to be informal and democratic. 

The judge's bench had been removed from the old Philadelphia courtroom for 
this occasion, and replaced by a table on a wooden platform; it gave the room 
an atmosphere suggesting the kind of meeting where a presiding body puts 
something over on a mentally retarded membership. 

One of the judges, acting as prosecutor, had read the charges. "You may 
now offer whatever plea you wish to make in your own defense, " 

he announced. 

Facing the platform, his voice inf lectionless and peculiarly clear, Hank 
Rearden answered: "I have no defense." 

"Do you—" The judge stumbled; he had not expected it to be that easy. "Do 
you throw yourself upon the mercy of this court?" 

"I do not recognize this court's right to try me." 

"What?" 

"I do not recognize this court's right to try me." 



"But, Mr. Rearden, this is the legally appointed court to try this 
particular category of crime." 

"I do not recognize my action as a crime," 

"But you have admitted that you have broken our regulations controlling 
the sale of your Metal." 

"I do not recognize your right to control the sale of my Metal." 

"Is it necessary for me to point out that your recognition was not 
required? " 

"No. I am fully aware of it and I am acting accordingly." 

He noted the stillness of the room. By the rules of the complicated 
pretense which all those people played for one another's benefit, they should 
have considered his stand as incomprehensible folly; there should have been 
rustles of astonishment and derision; there were none; they sat still; they 
understood . 

"Do you mean that you are refusing to obey the law?" asked the judge. 

"No. I am complying with the law— to the letter. Your law holds that my 
life, my work and my property may be disposed of without my consent. Very 
well, you may now dispose of me without my participation in the matter. I 
will not play the part of defending myself, where no defense is possible, and 
I will not simulate the illusion of dealing with a tribunal of justice." 

"But, Mr. Rearden, the law provides specifically that you are to be given 
an opportunity to present your side of the case and to defend yourself." 

"A prisoner brought to trial can defend himself only if there is an 
objective principle of justice recognized by his judges, a principle 
upholding his rights, which they may not violate and which he can invoke. 

The law, by which you are trying me, holds that there are no principles, 
that I have no rights and that you may do with me whatever you please. Very 
well. Do it." 

"Mr. Rearden, the law which you are denouncing is based on the highest 
principle— the principle of the public good." 

"Who is the public? What does it hold as its good? There was a time when 
men believed that the good' was a concept to be defined by a code of moral 
values and that no man had the right to seek his good through the violation 
of the rights of another. If it is now believed that my fellow men may 
sacrifice me in any manner they please for the sake of whatever they deem to 
be their own good, if they believe that they may seize my property simply 
because they need it— well, so does any burglar. There is only this 
difference: the burglar does not ask me to sanction his act." 

A group of seats at the side of the courtroom was reserved for the 
prominent visitors who had come from New York to witness the trial. Dagny sat 
motionless and her face showed nothing but a solemn attention, the attention 
of listening with the knowledge that the flow of his words would determine 
the course of her life. Eddie Willers sat beside her. James Taggart had not 
come. Paul Larkin sat hunched forward, his face thrust out, pointed like an 
animal's muzzle, sharpened by a look of fear now turning into malicious 
hatred. Mr. Mowen, who sat beside him, was a man of greater innocence and 
smaller understanding; his fear was of a simpler nature; he listened in 
bewildered indignation and he whispered to Larkin, "Good God, now he's done 
it! Now he'll convince the whole country that all businessmen are enemies of 
the public good!" 

"Are we to understand," asked the judge, "that you hold your own interests 
above the interests of the public?" 

"I hold that such a question can never arise except in a society of 
cannibals . " 

"What . . . what do you mean?" 

"I hold that there is no clash of interests among men who do not demand 
the unearned and do not practice human sacrifices." 



"Are we to understand that if the public deems it necessary to curtail 
your profits, you do not recognize its right to do so?" 

"Why, yes, I do. The public may curtail my profits any time it wishes— by 
refusing to buy my product." 

"We are speaking of . . . other methods." 

"Any other method of curtailing profits is the method of looters —and I 
recognize it as such." 

"Mr. Rearden, this is hardly the way to defend yourself." 
"I said that I would not defend myself." 

"But this is unheard of! Do you realize the gravity of the charge against 
you?" 

"I do not care to consider it." 

"Do you realize the possible consequences of your stand?" 
"Fully. " 

"It is the opinion of this court that the facts presented by the 
prosecution seem to warrant no leniency. The penalty which this court has the 
power to impose on you is extremely severe." 

"Go ahead." 

"I beg your pardon?" 

"Impose it . " 

The three judges looked at one another. Then their spokesman turned back 
to Rearden. "This is unprecedented," he said. 

"It is completely irregular," said the second judge. "The law requires you 
to submit a plea in your own defense. Your only alternative is to state for 
the record that you throw yourself upon the mercy of the court." 

"I do not." 

"But you have to." 

"Do you mean that what you expect from me is some sort of voluntary 
action?" 
"Yes . " 

"I volunteer nothing." 

"But the law demands that the defendant's side be represented on the 
record . " 

"Do you mean that you need my help to make this procedure legal?" 
"Well, no . . . yes . . . that is, to complete the form." 
"I will not help you." 

The third and youngest judge, who had acted as prosecutor, snapped 
impatiently, "This is ridiculous and unfair! Do you want to let it look as if 
a man of your prominence had been railroaded without a—" He cut himself off 
short. Somebody at the back of the courtroom emitted a long whistle. 

"I want, " said Rearden gravely, "to let the nature of this procedure 
appear exactly for what it is. If you need my help to disguise it— I will not 
help you . " 

"But we are giving you a chance to defend yourself— and it is you who are 
re j ecting it . " 

"I will not help you to pretend that I have a chance. I will not help you 
to preserve an appearance of righteousness where rights are not recognized. I 
will not help you to preserve an appearance of rationality by entering a 
debate in which a gun is the final argument. I will not help you to pretend 
that you are administering justice." 

"But the law compels you to volunteer a defense!" 

There was laughter at the back of the courtroom. 

"That is the flaw in your theory, gentlemen, " said Rearden gravely, "and I 
will not help you out of it. If you choose to deal with men by means of 
compulsion, do so. But you will discover that you need the voluntary co- 
operation of your victims, in many more ways than you can see at present. And 
your victims should discover that it is their own volition— which you cannot 



force— that makes you possible. I choose to be consistent and I will obey you 
in the manner you demand. Whatever you wish me to do, I will do it at the 
point of a gun. If you sentence me to jail, you will have to send armed men 
to carry me there— I will not volunteer to move. If you fine me, you will have 
to seize my property to collect the fine— I will not volunteer to pay it. If 
you believe that you have the right to force me— use your guns openly. I will 
not help you to disguise the nature of your action." 

The eldest judge leaned forward across the table and his voice became 
suavely derisive: "You speak as if you were fighting for some sort of 
principle, Mr. Rearden, but what you're actually fighting for is only your 
property, isn't it?" 

"Yes, of course. I am fighting for my property. Do you know the kind of 
principle that represents?" 

"You pose as a champion of freedom, but it's only the freedom to make 
money that you're after." 

"Yes, of course. AH I want is the freedom to make money. Do you know what 
that freedom implies?" 

"Surely, Mr. Rearden, you wouldn't want your attitude to be misunderstood. 
You wouldn't want to give support to the widespread impression that you are a 
man devoid of social conscience, who feels no concern for the welfare of his 
fellows and works for nothing but his own profit." 

"I work for nothing but my own profit. I earn it." 

There was a gasp, not of indignation, but of astonishment, in the crowd 
behind him and silence from the judges he faced. He went on calmly: "No, I do 
not want my attitude to be misunderstood. I shall be glad to state it for the 
record. I am in full agreement with the facts of everything said about me in 
the newspapers— with the facts, but not with the evaluation. I work for 
nothing but my own profit— which I make by selling a product they need to men 
who are willing and able to buy it. I do not produce it for their benefit at 
the expense of mine, and they do not buy it for my benefit at the expense of 
theirs; I do not sacrifice my interests to them nor do they sacrifice theirs 
to me; we deal as equals by mutual consent to mutual advantage— and I am proud 
of every penny that I have earned in this manner. I am rich and I am proud of 
every penny I own. I have made my money by my own effort, in free exchange 
and through the voluntary consent of every man I dealt with— the voluntary 
consent of those who employed me when I started, the voluntary consent of 
those who work for me now, the voluntary consent of those who buy my product. 
I shall answer all the questions you are afraid to ask me openly. Do I wish 
to pay my workers more than their services are worth to me? I do not. Do I 
wish to sell my product for less than my customers are willing to pay me? I 
do not. Do I wish to sell it at a loss or give it away? I do not. If this is 
evil, do whatever you please about me, according to whatever standards you 
hold. These are mine. I am earning my own living, as every honest man must. I 
refuse to accept as guilt the fact of my own existence and the fact that I 
must work in order to support it. I refuse to accept as guilt the fact that I 
am able to do it and to do it well. I refuse to accept as guilt the fact that 
I am able to do it better than most people— the fact that my work is of 
greater value than the work of my neighbors and that more men are willing to 
pay I refuse to apologize for my ability— I refuse to apologize for my me. 

success— I refuse to apologize for my money. If this is evil, make the most 
of it. If this is what the public finds harmful to its interests, let the 
public destroy me. This is my code— and I will accept no other. 

I could say to you that I have done more good for my fellow men than you 
can ever hope to accomplish— but I will not say it, because I do not seek the 
good of others as a sanction for my right to exist, nor do I recognize the 
good of others as a justification for their seizure of my property or their 
destruction of my life. I will not say that the good of others was the 



purpose of my work— my own good was my purpose, and I despise the man who 
surrenders his. I could say to you that you do not serve the public good— that 
nobody's good can be achieved at the price of human sacrifices— that when you 
violate the rights of one man, you have violated the rights of all, and a 
public of rightless creatures is doomed to destruction. I could say to you 
that you will and can achieve nothing but universal devastation— as any looter 
must, when he runs out of victims. I could say it, but I won't. 

It is not your particular policy that I challenge, but your moral premise. 

If it were true that men could achieve their good by means of turning some 
men into sacrificial animals, and I were asked to immolate myself for the 
sake of creatures who wanted to survive at the price of my blood, if I were 
asked to serve the interests of society apart from, above and against my own— 
I would refuse, I would reject it as the most contemptible evil, I would 
fight it with every, power I possess, I would fight the whole of mankind, if 
one minute were all I could last before I were murdered, I would fight in the 
full confidence of the justice of my battle and of a living being's right to 
exist. Let there be no misunderstanding about me. If it is now the belief of 
my fellow men, who call themselves the public, that their good requires 
victims, then I say: The public good be damned, I will have no part of it!" 

The crowd burst into applause. 

Rearden whirled around, more startled than his judges. He saw faces that 
laughed in violent excitement, and faces that pleaded for help; he saw their 
silent despair breaking out into the open; he saw the same anger and 
indignation as his own, finding release in the wild defiance of their 
cheering; he saw the looks of admiration and the looks of hope. There were 
also the faces of loose-mouthed young men and maliciously unkempt females, 
the kind who led the booing in newsreel theaters at any appearance of a 
businessman on the screen; they did not attempt a counter-demonstration; they 
were silent. 

As he looked at the crowd, people saw in his face what the threats of the 
judges had not been able to evoke: the first sign of emotion. 

It was a few moments before they heard the furious beating of a gavel upon 
the table and one of the judges yelling: "—or I shall have the courtroom 
cleared ! " 

As he turned back to the table, Rearden 's eyes moved over the visitors' 
section. His glance paused on Dagny, a pause perceptible only to her, as if 
he were saying: It works. She would have appeared calm except that her eyes 
seemed to have become too large for her face. 

Eddie Willers was smiling the kind of smile that is a man's substitute for 
breaking into tears. Mr. Mowen looked stupefied. Paul Larkin was staring at 
the floor. There was no expression on Bertram Scudder's face on Lillian's. 
She sat at the end of a row, her legs crossed, a mink stole slanting from her 
right shoulder to her left hip; she looked at Rearden, not moving. 

In the complex violence of all the things he felt, he had time to 
recognize a touch of regret and of longing: there was a face he had hoped to 
see, had looked for from the start of the session, had wanted to be present 
more than any other face around him. But Francisco d'Anconia had not come. 

4LMr. Rearden," said the eldest judge, smiling affably, reproachfully and 
spreading his arms, "it is regrettable that you should have misunderstood us 
so completely. That's the trouble— that businessmen refuse to approach us in a 
spirit of trust and friendship. They seem to imagine that we are their 
enemies. Why do you speak of human sacrifices? What made you go to such an 
extreme? We have no intention of seizing your property or destroying your 
life. We do not seek to harm your interests. We are fully aware of your 
distinguished achievements. Our purpose is only to balance social pressures 
and do justice to all. This hearing is really intended, not as a trial, but 
as a friendly discussion aimed at mutual understanding and co-operation." 



"I do not co-operate at the point of a gun." 

"Why speak of guns? This matter is not serious enough to warrant such 
references. We are fully aware that the guilt in this case lies chiefly with 
Mr. Kenneth Danagger, who instigated this infringement of the law, who 
exerted pressure upon you and who confessed his guilt by disappearing in 
order to escape trial" 

"No. We did it by equal, mutual, voluntary agreement." 

"Mr. Rearden, " said the second judge, "you may not share some of our 
ideas, but when all is said and done, we're all working for the same cause. 
For the good of the people. We realize that you were prompted to disregard 
legal technicalities by the critical situation of the coal mines and the 
crucial importance of fuel to the public welfare." 

"No. I was prompted by my own profit and my own interests. 

What effect it had on the coal mines and the public welfare is for you to 
estimate. That was not my motive." 

Mr. Mowen stared dazedly about him and whispered to Paul Larkin, 
"Something's gone screwy here." 

"Oh, shut up!" snapped Larkin. 

"I am sure, Mr. Rearden," said the eldest judge, "that you do not really 
believe— nor docs the public— that we wish to treat you as a sacrificial 
victim. If anyone has been laboring under such a misapprehension, we are 
anxious to prove that it is not true." 

The judges retired to consider their verdict. They did not stay out long. 
They returned to an ominously silent courtroom— and announced that a fine of 
$5,000 was imposed on Henry Rearden, but that the sentence was suspended. 

Streaks of jeering laughter ran through the applause that swept the 
courtroom. The applause was aimed at Rearden, the laughter— at the judges. 

Rearden stood motionless, not turning to the crowd, barely hearing the 
applause. He stood looking at the judges. There was no triumph in his face, 
no elation, only the still intensity of contemplating a vision with a bitter 
wonder that was almost fear. He was seeing the enormity of the smallness of 
the enemy who was destroying the world. He felt as if, after a journey of 
years through a landscape of devastation, past the ruins of great factories, 
the wrecks of powerful engines, the bodies of invincible men, he had come 
upon the despoiler, expecting to find a giant— and had found a rat eager to 
scurry for cover at the first sound of a human step. If this is what has 
beaten us, he thought, the guilt is ours. 

He was jolted back into the courtroom by the people pressing to surround 
him. He smiled in answer to their smiles, to the frantic, tragic eagerness of 
their faces; there was a touch of sadness in his smile. 

"God bless you, Mr. Rearden!" said an old woman with a ragged shawl over 
her head. "Can't you save us, Mr. Rearden? They're eating us alive, and it's 
no use fooling anybody about how it's the rich that they're after— do you know 
what's happening to us?" 

"Listen, Mr. Rearden," said a man who looked like a factory worker, "it's 
the rich who ' re selling us down the river. Tell those wealthy bastards, 
who ' re so anxious to give everything away, that when they give away their 
palaces, they're giving away the skin off our backs." 

"I know it," said Rearden. 

The guilt is ours, he thought. If we who were the movers, the providers, 
the benefactors of mankind, were willing to let the brand of evil be stamped 
upon us and silently to bear punishment for our virtues— what sort of "good" 
did we expect to triumph in the world? 

He looked at the people around him. They had cheered him today; they had 
cheered him by the side of the track of the John Gait Line. 

But tomorrow they would clamor for a new directive from Wesley Mouch and a 
free housing project from Orren Boyle, while Boyle's girders collapsed upon 



their heads. They would do it, because they would be told to forget, as a 
sin, that which had made them cheer Hank Rearden. 

Why were they ready to renounce their highest moments as a sin? 

Why were they willing to betray the best within them? What made them 
believe that this earth was a realm of evil where despair was their natural 
fate? He could not name the reason, but he knew that it had to be named. He 
felt it as a huge question mark within the courtroom, which it was now his 
duty to answer. 

This was the real sentence imposed upon him, he thought— to discover what 
idea, what simple idea available to the simplest man, had made mankind accept 
the doctrines that led it to self-destruction. 

"Hank, I'll never think that it's hopeless, not ever again," said Dagny 
that evening, after the trial. "I'll never be tempted to quit. You've proved 
that the right always works and always wins—" She stopped, then added, "— 
provided one knows what is the right." 

Lillian said to him at dinner next day, "So you've won, have you?" 

Her voice was noncommittal; she said nothing else; she was watching him, 
as If studying a riddle. 

The Wet Nurse asked him at the mills, "Mr. Rearden, what's a moral 
premise?" "What you're going to have a lot of trouble with." 

The boy frowned, then shrugged and said, laughing, "God, that was a 
wonderful show! What a beating you gave them, Mr. Rearden! I sat by the radio 
and howled." "How do you know it was a beating?" "Well, it was, wasn't it?" 
"Are you sure of it?" "Sure I'm sure." "The thing that makes you sure is a 
moral premise." 

The newspapers were silent. After the exaggerated attention they had given 
to the case, they acted as if the trial were not worthy of notice. They 
printed brief accounts on unlikely pages, worded in such generalities that no 
reader could discover any hint of a controversial issue. 

The businessmen he met seemed to wish to evade the subject of his trial. 
Some made no comment at all, but turned away, their faces showing a peculiar 
resentment under the effort to appear noncommittal, as if they feared that 
the mere act of looking at him would be interpreted as taking a stand. Others 
ventured to comment: "In my opinion, Rearden, it was extremely unwise of you. 
. . . It seems to me that this is hardly the time to make enemies. ... We 
can't afford to arouse resentment." 

"Whose resentment?" he asked. 

"I don't think the government will like it." 
"You saw the consequences of that" 

"Well, I don't know . . . The public won't take it, there's bound to be a 
lot of indignation." 

"You saw how the public took it." 

"Well, I don't know . . . We've been trying hard not to give any grounds 
for all those accusations about selfish greed— and you've given ammunition to 
the enemy . " 

"Would you rather agree with the enemy that you have no right to your 
profits and your property?" 

"Oh, no, no, certainly not— but why go to extremes? There's always a middle 
ground . " 

"A middle ground between you and your murderers?" 
"Now why use such words?" 

"What I said at the trial, was it true or not?" 
"It's going to be misquoted and misunderstood." 
"Was it true or not?" 

"The public is too dumb to grapple with such issues." 
"Was it true or not?" 



"It's no time to boast about being rich— when the populace is starving. 
It's just goading them on to seize everything." 

"But telling them that you have no right to your wealth, while they have- 
is what's going to restrain them?" 

"Well, I don't know ..." 

"I don't like the things you said at your trial," said another man. 

"In my opinion, I don't agree with you at all. Personally, I'm proud to 
believe that I am working for the public good, not just for my own profit. I 
like to think that I have some goal higher than just earning my three meals a 
day and my Hammond limousine." 

"And I don't like that idea about no directives and no controls," 

said another. "I grant you they're running hog-wild and overdoing it. 

But— no controls at all? I don't go along with that. I think some controls 
are necessary. The ones which are for the public good." 

"I am sorry, gentlemen," said Rearden, "that I will be obliged to save 
your goddamn necks along with mine." 

A group of businessmen headed by Mr. Mowen did not issue any statements 
about the trial. But a week later they announced, with an inordinate amount 
of publicity, that they were endowing the construction of a playground for 
the children of the unemployed. 

Bertram Scudder did not mention the trial in his column. But ten days 
later, he wrote, among items of miscellaneous gossip: "Some idea of the 
public value of Mr. Hank Rearden may be gathered from the fact that of all 
social groups, he seems to be most unpopular with his own fellow businessmen. 
His old-fashioned brand of ruthlessness seems to be too much even for those 
predatory barons of profit." 

On an evening in December— when the street beyond his window was like a 
congested throat coughing with the horns of pre-Christmas traffic— Rearden sat 
in his room at the Wayne-Falkland Hotel, fighting an enemy more dangerous 
than weariness or fear: revulsion against the thought of having to deal with 
human beings. 

He sat, unwilling to venture into the streets of the city, unwilling to 
move, as if he were chained to his chair and to this room. He had tried for 
hours to ignore an emotion that felt like the pull of homesickness: his 
awareness that the only man whom he longed to see, was here, in this hotel, 
just a few floors above him. 

He had caught himself, in the past few weeks, wasting time in the lobby 
whenever he entered the hotel or left it, loitering unnecessarily at the mail 
counter or the newsstand, watching the hurried currents of people, hoping to 
see Francisco d'Anconia among them. He had caught himself eating solitary 
dinners in the restaurant of the Wayne-Falkland, with his eyes on the 
curtains of the entrance doorway, Now he caught himself sitting in his room, 
thinking that the distance was only a few floors. 

He rose to his feet, with a chuckle of amused indignation; he was acting, 
he thought, like a woman who waits for a telephone call and fights against 
the temptation to end the torture by making the first move. There was no 
reason, he thought, why he could not go to Francisco d'Anconia, if that was 
what he wanted. Yet when he told himself that he would, he felt some 
dangerous element of surrender in the intensity of his own relief. 

He made a step toward the phone, to call Francisco's suite, but stopped. 
It was not what he wanted; what he wanted was simply to walk in, unannounced, 
as Francisco had walked into his office; it was this that seemed to state 
some unstated right between them. 

On his way to the elevator, he thought: He won't be in or, if he is, 
you'll probably find him entertaining some floozie, which will serve you 
right. But the thought seemed unreal, he could not make it apply to the man 
he had seen at the mouth of the furnace— he stood confidently in the elevator, 



looking up— he walked confidently down the hall, feeling his bitterness relax 
into gaiety— he knocked at the door. 

Francisco's voice snapped, "Come in!" It had a brusque, absentminded 
sound. 

Rearden opened the door and stopped on the threshold. One of the hotel's 
costliest satin-shaded lamps stood in the middle of the floor, throwing a 
circle of light on wide sheets of drafting paper. Francisco d'Anconia, in 
shirt sleeves, a strand of hair hanging down over his face, lay stretched on 
the floor, on his stomach, propped up by his elbows, biting the end of a 
pencil in concentration upon some point of the intricate tracing before him. 
He did not look up, he seemed to have forgotten the knock. Rearden tried to 
distinguish the drawing: it looked like the section of a smelter. He stood 
watching in startled wonder; had he had the power to bring into reality his 
own image of Francisco d'Anconia, this was the picture he would have seen: 
the figure of a purposeful young worker intent upon a difficult task, In a 
moment, Francisco raised his head. In the next instant, he flung his body 
upward to a kneeling posture, looking at Rearden with a smile of incredulous 
pleasure. In the next, he seized the drawings and threw them aside too 
hastily, face down. 

"What did I interrupt?" asked Rearden. 

"Nothing much. Come in." He was grinning happily. Rearden felt suddenly 
certain that Francisco had waited, too, had waited for this as for a victory 
which he had not quite hoped to achieve. 

"What were you doing?" asked Rearden. 

"Just amusing myself." 

"Let me see it." 

"No." He rose and kicked the drawings aside. 

Rearden noted that if he had resented as impertinence Francisco's manner 
of proprietorship in his office, he himself was now guilty of the same 
attitude— because he offered no explanation for his visit, but crossed the 
room and sat down in an armchair, casually, as if he were at home. 

"Why didn't you come to continue what you had started?" he asked. 

"You have been continuing it brilliantly without my help." 

"Do you mean, my trial?" 

"I mean, your trial." 

"How do you know? You weren't there." 

Francisco smiled, because the tone of the voice confessed an added 
sentence: I was looking for you. "Don't you suppose I heard every word of it 
on the radio?" 

"You did? Well, how did you like hearing your own lines come over the air, 
with me as your stooge?" 

"You weren't, Mr. Rearden. They weren't my lines. Weren't they the things 
you had always lived by?" 

"Yes . " 

"I only helped you to see that you should have been proud to live by 
them. " 

"I am glad you heard it" 

"It was great, Mr. Rearden— and about three generations too late." 
"What do you mean?" 

"If one single businessman had had the courage, then, to say that he 
worked for nothing but his own profit— and to say it proudly— he would have 
saved the world." 

"I haven't given up the world as lost." 

"It isn't. It never can be. But oh God!— what he would have spared us!" 
"Well, I guess we have to fight, no matter what era we're caught in." 



"Yes . . . You know, Mr. Rearden, I would suggest that you get a 
transcript of your trial and read what you said. Then see whether you are 
practicing it fully and consistently— or not." 

"You mean that I'm not?" 

"See for yourself." 

"I know that you had a great deal to tell me, when we were interrupted, 
that night at the mills. Why don't you finish what you had to say?" 
"No. It's too soon." 

Francisco acted as if there were nothing unusual about this visit, as if 
he took it as a matter of natural course— as he had always acted in Rearden 's 
presence. But Rearden noted that he was not so calm as he wished to appear; 
he was pacing the room, in a manner that seemed a release for an emotion he 
did not want to confess; he had forgotten the lamp and it still stood on the 
floor as the room's sole illumination. 

"You've been taking an awful beating in the way of discoveries, haven't 
you?" said Francisco, "How did you like the behavior of your fellow 
businessmen?" 

"I suppose it was to be expected." 

His voice tense with the anger of compassion, Francisco said, "It's been 
twelve years and yet I'm still unable to see it indifferently!" The sentence 
sounded involuntary, as if, trying to suppress the sound of emotion, he had 
uttered suppressed words. 

"Twelve years— since what?" asked Rearden. 

There was an instant's pause, but Francisco answered calmly, "Since I 
understood what those men were doing," He added, "I know what you're going 
through right now . . . and what's still ahead." 

"Thanks," said Rearden. 

"For what?" 

"For what you're trying so hard not to show. But don't worry about me. I'm 
still able to stand it. . . . You know, I didn't come here because I wanted 
to talk about myself or even about the trial." 

"I'll agree to any subject you choose— in order to have you here." 

He said it in the tone of a courteous joke; but the tone could not 
disguise it; he meant it. "What did you want to talk about?" 

"You. " 

Francisco stopped. He looked at Rearden for a moment, then answered 
quietly, "All right." 

If that which Rearden felt could have gone directly into words, past the 
barrier of his will, he would have cried: Don't let me down— I need you— I am 
fighting all of them, I have fought to my limit and am condemned to fight 
beyond it— and, as sole ammunition possible to me, I need the knowledge of one 
single man whom I can trust, respect and admire. 

Instead, he said calmly, very simply— and the only note of a personal bond 
between them was that tone of sincerity which comes with a direct, 
unqualifiedly rational statement and implies the same honesty of mind in the 
listener— "You know, I think that the only real moral crime that one man can 
commit against another is the attempt to create, by his words or actions, an 
impression of the contradictory, the impossible, the irrational, and thus 
shake the concept of rationality in his victim." 

"That's true." 

"If I say that that is the dilemma you've put me in, would you help me by 
answering a personal question?" 
"I will try." 

"I don't have to tell you— I think you know it— that you are the man of the 
highest mind I have ever met. I am coming to accept, not as right, but at 
least as possible, the fact that you refuse to exercise your great ability in 
the world of today. But what a man does out of despair, is not necessarily a 



key to his character. I have always thought that the real key is in that 
which he seeks for his enjoyment. 

And this is what I find inconceivable: no matter what you've given up, so 
long as you chose to remain alive, how can you find any pleasure in spending 
a life as valuable as yours on running after cheap women and on an imbecile's 
idea of diversions?" 

Francisco looked at him with a fine smile of amusement, as if saying: No? 
You didn't want to talk about yourself? And what is it that you're confessing 
but the desperate loneliness which makes the question of my character more 
important to you than any other question right now? 

The smile merged into a soft, good-natured chuckle, as if the question 
involved no problem for him, no painful secret to reveal. "There's a way to 
solve every dilemma of that kind, Mr. Rearden. Check your premises." He sat 
down on the floor, settling himself gaily, informally, for a conversation he 
would enjoy. "Is it your own first-hand conclusion that I am a man of high 
mind?" 

"Yes . " 

"Do you know of your own first-hand knowledge that I spend my life running 
after women?" 

"You've never denied it." 

"Denied it? I've gone to a lot of trouble to create that impression." 
"Do you mean to say that it isn't true?" 

"Do I strike you as a man with a miserable inferiority complex?" 
"Good God, no!" 

"Only that kind of man spends his life running after women." 
"What do you mean?" 

"Do you remember what I said about money and about the men who seek to 
reverse the law of cause and effect? The men who try to replace the mind by 
seizing the products of the mind? Well, the mail who despises himself tries 
to gain self-esteem from sexual adventures —which can't be done, because sex 
is not the cause, but an effect and an expression of a man's sense of his own 
value . " 

"You'd better explain that." 

"Did it ever occur to you that it's the same issue? The men who think that 
wealth comes from material resources and has no intellectual root or meaning, 
are the men who think— for the same reason— that sex is a physical capacity 
which functions independently of one's mind, choice or code of values. They 
think that your body creates a desire and makes a choice for you— just about 
in some such way as if iron ore transformed itself into railroad rails of its 
own volition. Love is blind, they say; sex is impervious to reason and mocks 
the power of all philosophers. But, in fact, a man's sexual choice is the 
result and the sum of his fundamental convictions. Tell me what a man finds 
sexually attractive and I will tell you his entire philosophy of life. 

Show me the woman he sleeps with and I will tell you his valuation of 
himself. No matter what corruption he's taught about the virtue of 
selflessness, sex is the most profoundly selfish of all acts, an act which he 
cannot perform for any motive but his own en j oyment— j ust try to think of 
performing it in a spirit of selfless charity!— an act which is not possible 
in self-abasement, only in self-exaltation, only in the confidence of being 
desired and being worthy of desire. It is an act that forces him to stand 
naked in spirit, as well as in body, and to accept his real ego as., his 
standard of value. He will always be attracted to the woman who reflects his 
deepest vision of himself, the woman whose surrender permits him to 
experience— or to fake— a sense of self-esteem. The man who is proudly certain 
of his own value, will want the highest type of woman he can find, the woman 
he admires, the strongest, the hardest to conquer— because only the possession 
of a heroine will give him the sense of an achievement, not the possession of 



a brainless slut. He does not seek to . . . What's the matter?" he asked, 
seeing the look on Rearden's face, a look of intensity much beyond mere 
interest in an abstract discussion. 
"Go on," said Rearden tensely. 

"He does not seek to gain his value, he seeks to express it. There is no 
conflict between the standards of his mind and the desires of his body. But 
the man who is convinced of his own worthlessness will be drawn to a woman he 
despises— because she will reflect his own secret self, she will release him 
from that objective reality in which he is a fraud, she will give him a 
momentary illusion of his own value and a momentary escape from the moral 
code that damns him. Observe the ugly mess which most men make of their sex 
lives— and observe the mess of contradictions which they hold as their moral 
philosophy. One proceeds from the other. Love is our response to our highest 
values— 

and can be nothing else. Let a man corrupt his values and his view of 
existence, let him profess that love is not self-enjoyment but self-denial, 
that virtue consists, not of pride, but of pity or pain or weakness or 
sacrifice, that the noblest love is born, not of admiration, but of charity, 
not in response to values, but in response to flaws— and he will have cut 
himself in two. His body will not obey him, it will not respond, it will make 
him impotent toward the woman he professes to love and draw him to the lowest 
type of whore he can find. His body will always follow the ultimate logic of 
his deepest convictions; if he believes that flaws are values, he has damned 
existence as evil and only the evil will attract him. He has damned himself 
and he will feel that depravity is all he is worthy of enjoying. He has 
equated virtue with pain and he will feel that vice is the only realm of 
pleasure. Then he will scream that his body has vicious desires of its own 
which his mind cannot conquer, that sex is sin, that true love is a pure 
emotion of the spirit. And then he will wonder why love brings him nothing 
but boredom, and sex— nothing but shame." 

Rearden said slowly, looking off, not realizing that he was thinking 
aloud, "At least . . . I've never accepted that other tenet . . . I've never 
felt guilty about making money." 

Francisco missed the significance of the first two words; he smiled and 
said eagerly, "You do see that it's the same issue? No, you'd never accept 
any part of their vicious creed. You wouldn't be able to force it upon 
yourself. If you tried to damn sex as evil, you'd still find yourself, 
against your will, acting on the proper moral premise. You'd be attracted to 
the highest woman you met. You'd always want a heroine. You'd be incapable of 
self-contempt. You'd be unable to believe that existence is evil and that 
you're a helpless creature caught in an impossible universe. You're the man 
who's spent his life shaping matter to the purpose of his mind. You're the 
man who would know that just as an idea unexpressed in physical action is 
contemptible hypocrisy, so is platonic love— and just as physical action 
unguided by an idea is a fool's self-fraud, so is sex when cut off from one's 
code of values. It's the same issue, and you would know it. Your inviolate 
sense of self-esteem would know it. You would be incapable of desire for a 
woman you despised. Only the man who extols the purity of a love devoid of 
desire, is capable of the depravity of a desire devoid of love. But observe 
that most people are creatures cut in half who keep swinging desperately to 
one side or to the other. One kind of half is the man who despises money, 
factories, skyscrapers and his own body. 

He holds undefined emotions about non-conceivable subjects as the meaning 
of life and as his claim to virtue. And he cries with despair, because he can 
feel nothing for the women he respects, but finds himself in bondage to an 
irresistible passion for a slut from the gutter. 



He is the man whom people call an idealist. The other kind of half is the 
man whom people call practical, the man who despises principles, 
abstractions, art, philosophy and his own mind. He regards the acquisition of 
material objects as the only goal of existence— and he laughs at the need to 
consider their purpose or their source. He expects them to give him pleasure— 
and he wonders why the more he gets, the less he feels. He is the man who 
spends his time chasing women. Observe the triple fraud which he perpetrates 
upon himself. He will not acknowledge his need of self-esteem, since he 
scoffs at such a concept as moral values; yet he feels the profound self- 
contempt which comes from believing that he is a piece of meat. He will not 
acknowledge, but he knows that sex is the physical expression of a tribute to 
personal values. So he tries, by going through the motions of the effect, to 
acquire that which should have been the cause. He tries to gain a sense of 
his own value from the women who surrender to him— and he forgets that the 
women he picks have neither character nor judgment nor standard of value. He 
tells himself that all he's after is physical pleasure- 
but observe that he tires of his women in a week or a night, that he 
despises professional whores and that he loves to imagine he is seducing 
virtuous girls who make a great exception for his sake. It is the feeling, of 
achievement that he seeks and never finds. What glory can there be in the 
conquest of a mindless body? Now that is your woman-chaser. Does the 
description fit me?" 
"God, no!" 

"Then you can judge, without asking my word for it, how much chasing of 
women I've done in my life." 

"But what on earth have you been doing on the front pages of newspapers 
for the last— isn't it twelve— years ? " 

"I've spent a lot of money on the most ostentatiously vulgar parties I 
could think of, and a miserable amount of time on being seen with the 
appropriate sort of women. As for the rest—" He stopped, then said, "I have 
some friends who know this, but you are the first person to whom I am 
confiding it against my own rules: I have never slept with any of those 
women. I have never touched one of them." 

"What is more incredible than that, is that I believe you." 

The lamp on the floor beside him threw broken bits of light across 
Francisco's face, as he leaned forward; the face had a look of guiltless 
amusement. "If you care to glance over those front pages, you'll see that 
I've never said anything. It was the women who were eager to rush into print 
with stories insinuating that being seen with me at a restaurant was the sign 
of a great romance. What do you suppose those women are after but the same 
thing as the chaser— the desire to gain their own value from the number and 
fame of the men they conquer? Only it's one step phonier, because the value 
they seek is not even in the actual fact, but in the impression on and the 
envy of other women. Well, I gave those bitches what they wanted— but what 
they literally wanted, without the pretense that they expected, the pretense 
that hides from Them the nature of their wish. Do you think they wanted to 
sleep with me or with any man? They wouldn't be capable of so real and honest 
a desire. They wanted food for their vanity— and I gave it to them. I gave 
them the chance to boast to their friends and to see themselves in the 
scandal sheets in the roles of great seductresses . But do you know that it 
works in exactly the same way as what you did at your trial? If you want to 
defeat any kind of vicious fraud— comply with it literally, adding nothing of 
your own to disguise its nature. Those women understood. They saw whether 
there's any satisfaction in being envied by others for a feat one has not 
achieved. Instead of self-esteem, their publicized romances with me have 
given them a deeper sense of inferiority: each one of them knows that she's 
tried and failed. If dragging me into bed is supposed to be her public 



standard of value, she knows that she couldn't live up to it. I think those 
women hate me more than any other man on. 

earth. But my secret is safe— because each one of them thinks that she was 
the only one who failed, while all the others succeeded, so she'll be the 
more vehement in swearing to our romance and will never admit the truth to 
anybody . " 

"But what have you done to your own reputation?" 

Francisco shrugged. "Those whom I respect, will know the truth about me, 
sooner or later. The others"— his face hardened— "the others consider that 
which I really am as evil. Let them have what they prefer— what I appear to be 
on the front pages." 

"But what for? Why did you do it? Just to teach them a lesson?" 

"Hell, no! I wanted to be known as a playboy." 

"Why?" 

"A playboy is a man who just can't help letting money run through his 
fingers . " 

"Why did you want to assume such an ugly sort of role?" 
"Camouflage . " 
"For what?" 

"For a purpose of my own." 
"What purpose?" 

Francisco shook his head. "Don't ask me to tell you that. I've told you 
more than I should. You'll come to know the rest of it soon, anyway." 
"If it's more than you should, why did you tell me?" 

"Because . . . you've made me become impatient for the first time in 
years." The note of a suppressed emotion came back into his voice. 

"Because I've never wanted anyone to know the truth about me as I wanted 
you to know it. Because I knew that you'd despise a playboy more than any 
other sort of man— as I would, too. Playboy? I've never loved but one woman in 
my life and still do and always will!" It was an involuntary break, and he 
added, his voice low, "I've never confessed that to anyone . . . not even to 
her. " 

"Have you lost her?" 

Francisco sat looking off into space; in a moment, he answered tonelessly, 
"I hope not." 

The light of the lamp hit his face from below, and Rearden could not see 
his eyes, only his mouth drawn in lines of endurance and oddly solemn 
resignation. Rearden knew that this was a wound not to be probed any further. 

With one of his swift changes of mood, Francisco said, "Oh well, it's just 
a little longer!" and rose to his feet, smiling. 

"Since you trust me," said Rearden, "I want to tell you a secret of mine 
in exchange. I want you to, know how much I trusted you before I came here. 
And I might need your help later." 

"You're the only man left whom I'd like to help." 

"There's a great deal that I don't understand about you, but I'm certain 
of one thing: that you're not a friend of the looters." 

"I'm not." There was a hint of amusement in Francisco's face, as at an 
understatement . 

"So I know that you won't betray me if I tell you that I'm going to 
continue selling Rearden Metal to customers of my own choice in any amount I 
wish, whenever I see a chance to do it. Right now, I'm getting ready to pour 
an order twenty times the size of the one they tried me for." 

Sitting on the arm of a chair, a few feet away, Francisco leaned forward 
to look at him silently, frowning, for a long moment, "Do you think that 
you're fighting them by doing it?" he asked. 

"Well, what would you call it? Co-operating?" 



"You were willing to work and produce Rearden Metal for them at the price 
of losing your profits, losing your friends, enriching stray bastards who had 
the pull to rob you, and taking their abuse for the privilege of keeping them 
alive. Now you're willing to do it at the price of accepting the position of 
a criminal and the risk of being thrown in jail at any moment— for the sake of 
keeping in existence a system which can be kept going only by its victims, 
only by the breaking of its own laws." 

"It's not for their system, but for customers whom I can't abandon to the 
mercy of their system— I intend to outlast that system of theirs —I don't 
intend to let them stop me, no matter how hard they make it for me— and I 
don't intend to give up the world to them, even if I am the last man left. 
Right now, that illegal order is more important to me than the whole of my 
mills . " 

Francisco shook his head slowly and did not answer; then he asked, "To 
which one of your friends in the copper industry are you going to give the 
valuable privilege of informing on you this time?" 

Rearden smiled. "Not this time. This time, I'm dealing with a man I can 
trust. " 

"Really? Who is it?" 

"You. " 

Francisco sat up straight. "What?" he asked, his voice so low that he 
almost succeeded in hiding the sound of a gasp. 

Rearden was smiling. "You didn't know that I'm one of your customers now? 
It was done through a couple of stooges and under a phony name— but I'll need 
your help to prevent anyone on your staff from becoming inquisitive about it. 
I need that copper, I need it on time— and I don't care if they arrest me 
later, so long as I get this through. I know that you've lost all concern for 
your company, your wealth, your work, because you don't care to deal with 
looters like Taggart and Boyle. But if you meant all the things you taught 
me, if I am the last man left whom you respect, you'll help me to survive and 
to beat them. I've never asked for anyone's help. I'm asking for yours. 

I need you. I trust you. You've always professed your admiration for me. 
Well, there's my life in your hands— if you want it. An order of d'Anconia 
copper is being shipped to me right now. It left San Juan on December fifth." 

"What? ! " 

It was a scream of plain shock. Francisco had shot to his feet, past any 
attempt to hide anything. "On December fifth?" 
"Yes," said Rearden, stupefied. 

Francisco leaped to the telephone. "I told you not to deal with d'Anconia 
Copper!" It was the half-moaning, half-furious cry of despair. 

His hand was reaching for the telephone, but jerked back. He grasped the 
edge of the table, as if to stop himself from lifting the receiver, and he 
stood, head down, for how long a time neither he nor Rearden could tell. 
Rearden was held numb by the fact of watching an agonized struggle with the 
motionless figure of a man as its only evidence. He could not guess the 
nature of the struggle, he knew only that there was something which Francisco 
had the power to prevent in that moment and that it was a power which he 
would not use. 

When Francisco raised his head, Rearden saw a face drawn by so great a 
suffering that its lines were almost an audible cry of pain, the more 
terrible because the face had a look of firmness, as if the decision had been 
made and this was the price of it. 

"Francisco . . . what's the matter?" 

"Hank, I . . . " He shook his head, stopped, then stood up straight. 
"Mr. Rearden," he said, in a voice that had the strength, the despair and 
the peculiar dignity of a plea he knew to be hopeless, "for the time when 



you're going to damn me, when you're going to doubt every word I said ... I 
swear to you— by the woman I love— that I am your friend." 

The memory of Francisco's face as it looked in that moment, came back to 
Rearden three days later, through a blinding shock of loss and hatred— it came 
back, even though, standing by the radio in his office, he thought that he 
must now keep away from the Wayne-Falkland or he would kill Francisco 
d'Anconia on sight— it kept coming back to him, through the words he was 
hearing— he was hearing that three ships of d'Anconia copper, bound from San 
Juan to New York, had been attacked by Ragnar Danneskjold and sent to the 
bottom of the ocean— it kept coming back, even though he knew that much more 
than the copper had gone down for him with those ships. 



CHAPTER V 
ACCOUNT OVERDRAWN 



It was the first failure in the history of Rearden Steel. For the first 
time, an order was not delivered as promised. But by February 15, when the 
Taggart rail was due, it made no difference to anyone any longer. 

Winter had come early, in the last days of November. People said that it 
was the hardest winter on record and that no one could be blamed for the 
unusual severity of the snowstorms. They did not care to remember that there 
had been a time when snowstorms did not sweep, unresisted, down unlighted 
roads and upon the roofs of unheated houses, did not stop the movement of 
trains, did not leave a wake of corpses counted by the hundreds. 

The first time that Danagger Coal was late in delivering fuel to Taggart 
Transcontinental, in the last week of December, Danagger 's cousin explained 
that he could not help it; he had had to cut the workday down to six hours, 
he said, in order to raise the morale of the men who did not seem to function 
as they had in the days of his cousin Kenneth; the men had become listless 
and sloppy, he said, because they were exhausted by the harsh discipline of 
the former management; he could not help it if some of the superintendents 
and foremen had quit him without reason, men who had been with the company 
for ten to twenty years; he could not help it if there seemed to be some 
friction between his workers and his new supervisory staff, even though the 
new men were much more liberal than the old slave drivers; it was only a 
matter of readjustment, he said. He could not help it, he said, if the 
tonnage intended for Taggart Transcontinental had been turned over, on the 
eve of its scheduled delivery, to the Bureau of Global Relief for shipment to 
the People's State of England; it was an emergency, the people of England 
were starving, with all of their State factories closing down— and Miss 
Taggart was being unreasonable, since it was only a matter of one day's 
delay. 

It was only one day's delay. It caused a three days' delay in the run of 
Freight Train Number 386, bound from California to New York with fifty-nine 
carloads of lettuce and oranges. Freight Train Number 386 waited on sidings, 
at coaling stations, for the fuel that had not arrived. When the train 
reached New York, the lettuce and oranges had to be dumped into the East 
River: they had waited their turn too long in the freight houses of 
California, with the train schedules cut and the engines forbidden, by 
directive, to pull a train of more than sixty cars. 

Nobody but their friends and trade associates noticed that three orange 
growers in California went out of business, as well as two lettuce farmers in 
Imperial Valley; nobody noticed the closing of a commission house in New 
York, of a plumbing company to which the commission house owed money, of a 
lead-pipe wholesaler who had supplied the plumbing company. When people were 
starving, said the newspapers, one did not have to feel concern over the 
failures of business enterprises which were only private ventures for private 
profit . 

The coal shipped across the Atlantic by the Bureau of Global Relief did 
not reach the People's State of England: it was seized by Ragnar Danneskjold. 

The second time that Danagger Coal was late in delivering fuel to Taggart 
Transcontinental, in mid-January, Danagger 's cousin snarled over the 
telephone that he could not help it: his mines had been shut down for three 
days, due to a shortage of lubricating oil for the machinery. The supply of 
coal to Taggart Transcontinental was four days late. 

Mr. Quinn, of the Quinn Ball Bearing Company which had once moved from 
Connecticut to Colorado, waited a week for the freight train that carried his 



order of Rearden steel. When the train arrived, the doors of the Quinn Ball 
Bearing Company's plant were closed. 

Nobody traced the closing of a motor company in Michigan, that had waited 
for a shipment of ball bearings, its machinery idle, its workers on full pay; 
or the closing of a sawmill in Oregon, that had waited for a new motor; or 
the closing of a lumber yard in Iowa, left without supply; or the bankruptcy 
of a building contractor in Illinois who, failing to get his lumber on time, 
found his contracts cancelled and the purchasers of his homes sent wandering 
off down snowswept roads in search of that which did not exist anywhere any 
longer . 

The snowstorm that came at the end of January blocked the passes through 
the Rocky Mountains, raising white walls thirty feet high across the main- 
line track of Taggart Transcontinental. The men who attempted to clear the 
track, gave up within the first few hours: the rotary plows broke down, one 
after another. The plows had been kept in precarious repair for two years 
past the span of their usefulness. The new plows had not been delivered; the 
manufacturer had quit, unable to obtain the steel he needed from Orren Boyle. 

Three westbound trains were trapped on the sidings of Winston Station, 
high in the Rockies, where the main line of Taggart Transcontinental cut 
across the northwest corner of Colorado. For five days, they remained beyond 
the reach of help. Trains could not approach them through the storm. The last 
of the trucks made by Lawrence Hammond broke down on the frozen grades of the 
mountain highways. 

The best of the airplanes once made by Dwight Sanders were sent out, but 
never reached Winston Station; they were worn past the stage of fighting a 
storm. 

Through the driving mesh of snow, the passengers trapped aboard the trains 
looked out at the lights of Winston's shanties. The lights died in the night 
of the second day. By the evening of the third, the lights, the heat and the 
food had given out aboard the trains. In the brief lulls of the storm, when 
the white mesh vanished and left behind it the stillness of a black void 
merging a lightless earth with a starless sky— 

the passengers could see, many miles away to the south, a small tongue of 
flame twisting in the wind. It was Wyatt ' s Torch. 

By the morning of the sixth day, when the trains were able to move and 
proceeded down the slopes of Utah, of Nevada, of California, the trainmen 
observed the smokeless stacks and the closed doors of small trackside 
factories, which had not been closed on their last run. 

"Storms are an act of God, " wrote Bertram Scudder, "and nobody can be held 
socially responsible for the weather." 

The rations of coal, established by Wesley Mouch, permitted the heating of 
homes for three hours a day. There was no wood to burn, no metal to make new 
stoves, no tools to pierce the walls of the houses for new installations. In 
makeshift contraptions of bricks and oil cans, professors were burning the 
books of their libraries, and fruit growers were burning the trees of their 
orchards. "Privations strengthen a people's spirit," wrote Bertram Scudder, 
"and forge the fine steel of social discipline. Sacrifice is the cement which 
unites human bricks into the great edifice of society." 

"The nation which had once held the creed that greatness is achieved by 
production, is now told that it is achieved by squalor, " said Francisco 
d'Anconia in a press interview. But this was not printed. 

The only business boom, that winter, came to the amusement industry. 
People wrenched their pennies out of the quicksands of their food and heat 
budgets, and went without meals in order to crowd into movie theaters, in 
order to escape for a few hours the state of animals reduced to the single 
concern of terror over their crudest needs. In January, all movie theaters, 
night clubs and bowling alleys were closed by order of Wesley Mouch, for the 



purpose of conserving fuel. "Pleasure is not an essential of existence," 
wrote Bertram Scudder. 

"You must learn to take a philosophical attitude," said Dr. Simon 
Pritchett to a young girl student who broke down into sudden, hysterical sobs 
in the middle of a lecture. She had just returned from a volunteer relief 
expedition to a settlement on Lake Superior; she had seen a mother holding 
the body of a grown son who had died of hunger. 

"There are no absolutes," said Dr. Pritchett. "Reality is only an 
illusion . 

How does that woman know that her son is dead? How does she know that he 
ever existed?" 

People with pleading eyes and desperate faces crowded into tents where 
evangelists cried in triumphant gloating that man was unable to cope with 
nature, that his science was a fraud, that his mind was a failure, that he 
was reaping punishment for the sin of pride, for his confidence in his own 
intellect— and that only faith in the power of mystic secrets could protect 
him from the fissure of a rail or from the blowout of the last tire on his 
last truck. Love was the key to the mystic secrets, they cried, love and 
selfless sacrifice to the needs of others. 

Orren Boyle made a selfless sacrifice to the needs of others. He sold to 
the Bureau of Global Relief, for shipment to the People's State of Germany, 
ten thousand tons of structural steel shapes that had been intended for the 
Atlantic Southern Railroad. "It was a difficult decision to make," he said, 
with a moist, unfocused look of righteousness, to the panic-stricken 
president of the Atlantic Southern, "but I weighed the fact that you're a 
rich corporation, while the people of Germany are in a state of unspeakable 
misery. So I acted on the principle that need comes first. When in doubt, 
it's the weak that must be considered, not the strong." The president of the 
Atlantic Southern had heard that Orren Boyle's most valuable friend in 
Washington had a friend in the Ministry of Supply of the People's State of 
Germany. But whether this had been Boyle's motive or whether it had been the 
principle of sacrifice, no one could tell and it made no difference: if Boyle 
had been a saint of the creed of selflessness, he would have had to do 
precisely what he had done. This silenced the president of the Atlantic 
Southern; he dared not admit that he cared for his railroad more than for the 
people of Germany; he dared not argue against the principle of sacrifice. 

The waters of the Mississippi had been rising all through the month of 
January, swollen by the storms, driven by the wind into a restless grinding 
of current against current and against every obstruction in their way. On a 
night of lashing sleet, in the first week of February, the Mississippi bridge 
of the Atlantic Southern collapsed under a passenger train. The engine and 
the first five sleepers went down with the cracking girders into the twisting 
black spirals of water eighty feet below. The rest of the train remained on 
the first three spans of the bridge, which held. 

"You can't have your cake and let your neighbor eat it, too," said 
Francisco d'Anconia. The fury of denunciations which the holders of public 
voices unleashed against him was greater than their concern over the horror 
at the river. 

It was whispered that the chief engineer of the Atlantic Southern, in 
despair over the company's failure to obtain the steel he needed to reinforce 
the bridge, had resigned six months ago, telling the company that the bridge 
was unsafe. He had written a letter to the largest newspaper in New York, 
warning the public about it; the letter had not been printed. It was 
whispered that the first three spans of the bridge had held because they had 
been reinforced with structural shapes of Rearden Metal; but five hundred 
tons of the Metal was all that the railroad had been able to obtain under the 
Fair Share Law. 



As the sole result of official investigations, two bridges across the 
Mississippi, belonging to smaller railroads, were condemned. One of the 
railroads went out of business; the other closed a branch line, tore up its 
rail and laid a track to the Mississippi bridge of Taggart Transcontinental; 
so did the Atlantic Southern. 

The great Taggart Bridge at Bedford, Illinois, had been built by Nathaniel 
Taggart. He had fought the government for years, because the courts had 
ruled, on the complaint of river shippers, that railroads were a destructive 
competition to shipping and thus a threat to the public welfare, and that 
railroad bridges across the Mississippi were to be forbidden as a material 
obstruction; the courts had ordered Nathaniel Taggart to tear down his bridge 
and to carry his passengers across the river by means of barges. He had won 
that battle by a majority of one voice on the Supreme Court. His bridge was 
now the only major link left to hold the continent together. His last 
descendant had made it her strictest rule that whatever else was neglected, 
the Taggart Bridge would always be maintained in flawless shape. 

The steel shipped across the Atlantic by the Bureau of Global Relief had 
not reached the People's State of Germany. It had been seized by Ragnar 
Danneskj old— but nobody heard of it outside the Bureau, because the newspapers 
had long since stopped mentioning the activities of Ragnar Danneskjold. 

It was not until the public began to notice the growing shortage, then the 
disappearance from the market of electric irons, toasters, washing machines 
and all electrical appliances, that people began to ask questions and to hear 
whispers. They heard that no ship loaded with d'Anconia copper was able to 
reach a port of the United States; it could not get past Ragnar Danneskjold. 

In the foggy winter nights, on the waterfront, sailors whispered the story 
that Ragnar Danneskjold always seized the cargoes of relief vessels, but 
never touched the copper: he sank the d'Anconia ships with their loads; he 
let the crews escape in lifeboats, but the copper went to the bottom of the 
ocean. They whispered it as a dark legend beyond men's power to explain; 
nobody could find a reason why Danneskjold did not choose to take the copper. 

In the second week of February, for the purpose of conserving copper wire 
and electric power, a directive forbade the running of elevators above the 
twenty-fifth floor. The upper floors of the buildings had to be vacated, and 
partitions of unpainted boards went up to cut off the stairways. By special 
permit, exceptions were granted— on the grounds of "essential need"— to a few 
of the larger business enterprises and the more fashionable hotels. The tops 
of the cities were cut down. 

The inhabitants of New York had never had to be aware of the weather. 
Storms had been only a nuisance that slowed the traffic and made puddles in 
the doorways of brightly lighted shops. Stepping against the wind, dressed in 
raincoats, furs and evening slippers, people had felt that a storm was an 
intruder within the city. Now, facing the gusts of snow that came sweeping 
down the narrow streets, people felt in dim terror that they were the 
temporary intruders and that the wind had the right-of-way. 

"It won't make any difference to us now, forget it, Hank, it doesn't 
matter, " said Dagny when Rearden told her that he would not be able to 
deliver the rail; he had not been able to find a supplier of copper. 

"Forget it, Hank." He did not answer her. He could not forget the first 
failure of Rearden Steel. 

On the evening of February 15, a plate cracked on a rail joint and sent an 
engine off the track, half a mile from Winston, Colorado, on a division which 
was to have been relaid with the new rail. The station agent of Winston 
sighed and sent for a crew with a crane; it was only one of the minor 
accidents that were happening in his section every other day or so, he was 
getting used to it. 



Rearden, that evening, his coat collar raised, his hat slanted low over 
his eyes, the snow drifts rising to his knees, was tramping through an 
abandoned open-pit coal mine, in a forsaken corner of Pennsylvania, 
supervising the loading of pirated coal upon the trucks which he had 
provided. Nobody owned the mine, nobody could afford the cost of working it. 
But a young man with a brusque voice and dark, angry eyes, who came from a 
starving settlement, had organized a gang of the unemployed and made a deal 
with Rearden to deliver the coal. 

They mined it at night, they stored it in hidden culverts, they were paid 
in cash, with no questions asked or answered. Guilty of a fierce desire to 
remain alive, they and Rearden traded like savages, without rights, titles, 
contracts or protection, with nothing but mutual understanding and a 
ruthlessly absolute observance of one's given word. Rearden did not even know 
the name of the young leader. Watching him at the job of loading the trucks, 
Rearden thought that this boy, if born a generation earlier, would have 
become a great industrialist; now, he would probably end his brief life as a 
plain criminal in a few more years. 

Dagny, that evening, was facing a meeting of the Taggart Board of 
Directors . 

They sat about a polished table in a stately Board room which was 
inadequately heated. The men who, through the decades of their careers, had 
relied for their security upon keeping their faces blank, their words 
inconclusive and their clothes impeccable, were thrown off-key by the 
sweaters stretched over their stomachs, by the mufflers wound about their 
necks, by the sound of coughing that cut through the discussion too 
frequently, like the rattle of a machine gun. 

She noted that Jim had lost the smoothness of his usual performance. 

He sat with his head drawn into his shoulders, and his eyes kept darting 
too rapidly from face to face. 

A man from Washington sat at the table among them. Nobody knew his exact 
job or title, but it was not necessary: they knew that he was the man from 
Washington. His name was Mr. Weatherby, he had graying temples, a long, 
narrow face and a mouth that looked as if he had to stretch his facial 
muscles in order to keep it closed; this gave a suggestion of primness to a 
face that displayed nothing else. The Directors did not know whether he was 
present as the guest, the adviser or the ruler of the Board; they preferred 
not to find out. 

"It seems to me, " said the chairman, "that the top problem for us to 
consider is the fact that the track of our main line appears to be in a 
deplorable, not to say critical, condition—" He paused, then added 
cautiously, "—while the only good rail we own is that of the John Gait— I 
mean, the Rio Norte— Line." 

In the same cautious tone of waiting for someone else to pick up the 
intended purpose of his words, another man said, "If we consider our critical 
shortage of equipment, and if we consider that we are letting it wear out in 
the service of a branch line running at a loss—" He stopped and did not state 
what would occur if they considered it. 

"In my opinion, " said a thin, pallid man with a neat mustache, "the Rio 
Norte Line seems to have become a financial burden which the company might 
not be able to carry— that is, not unless certain readjustments are made, 
which—" He did not finish, but glanced at Mr. 

Weatherby. Mr. Weatherby looked as if he had not noticed it. 

"Jim," said the chairman, "I think you might explain the picture to Mr. 
Weatherby . " 

Taggart 's voice still retained a practiced smoothness, but it was the 
smoothness of a piece of cloth stretched tight over a broken glass object, 
and the sharp edges showed through once in a while: "I think it is generally 



conceded that the main factor affecting every railroad in the country is the 
unusual rate of business failures. While we all realize, of course, that this 
is only temporary, still, for the moment, it has made the railroad situation 
approach a stage that may well be described as desperate. Specifically, the 
number of factories which have closed throughout the territory of the Taggart 
Transcontinental system is so large that it has wrecked our entire financial 
structure. Districts and divisions which had always brought us our steadiest 
revenues, are now showing an actual operating loss. A train schedule geared 
to a heavy volume of freight cannot be maintained for three shippers where 
there had once been seven. We cannot give them the same service— at least, not 
at . . . our present rates." He glanced at Mr. Weatherby, but Mr. 

Weatherby did not seem to notice. "It seems to me," said Taggart, the 
sharp edges becoming sharper in his voice, "that the stand taken by our 
shippers is unfair. Most of them have been complaining about their 
competitors and have passed various local measures to eliminate competition 
in their particular fields. Now most of them are practically in sole 
possession of their markets, yet they refuse to realize that a railroad 
cannot give to one lone factory the freight rates which had been made 
possible by the production of a whole region. We are running our trains for 
them at a loss, yet they have taken a stand against any . . . raise in 
rates . " 

"Against any raise?" said Mr. Weatherby mildly, with a good imitation of 
astonishment. "That is not the stand they have taken." 

"If certain rumors, which I refuse to credit, are true—" said the 
chairman, and stopped one syllable after the tone of panic had become obvious 
in his voice. 

"Jim," said Mr. Weatherby pleasantly, "I think it would be best if we just 
didn't mention the subject of raising the rates." 

"I wasn't suggesting an actual raise at this time," said Taggart hastily. 
"I merely referred to it to round out the picture." 

"But, Jim," said an old man with a quavering voice, "I thought that your 
influence— I mean, your friendship— with Mr. Mouch would insure ..." 

He stopped, because the others were looking at him severely, in reproof 
for the breach of an unwritten law: one did not mention a failure of this 
kind, one did not discuss the mysterious ways of Jim's powerful friendships 
or why they had failed him. 

"Fact is," said Mr. Weatherby easily, "that Mr. Mouch sent me here to 
discuss the demand of the railway unions for a raise in wages and the demand 
of the shippers for a cut in rates." 

He said it in a tone of casual firmness; he knew that all these men had 
known it, that the demands had been discussed in the newspapers for months; 
he knew that the dread in these men's minds was not of the fact, but of his 
naming it — as if the fact had not existed, but his words held the power to 
make it exist; he knew that they had waited to see whether he would exercise 
that power; he was letting them know that he would. 

Their situation warranted an outcry of protest; there was none; nobody 
answered him. Then James Taggart said in that biting, nervous tone which is 
intended to convey anger, but merely confesses uncertainty, "I wouldn't 
exaggerate the importance of Buzzy Watts of the National Shippers Council. 
He's been making a lot of noise and giving a lot of expensive dinners in 
Washington, but I wouldn't advise taking it too seriously." 

"Oh, I don't know," said Mr. Weatherby. 

"Listen, Clem, I do know that Wesley refused to see him last week." 
"That's true. Wesley is a pretty busy man." 

"And I know that when Gene Lawson gave that big party ten days ago, 
practically everybody was there, but Buzzy Watts was not invited." 
"That's so," said Mr. Weatherby peaceably. 



"So I wouldn't bet on Mr. Buzzy Watts, Clem. And I wouldn't let it worry 
me . " 

"Wesley's an impartial man," said Mr. Weatherby. "A man devoted to public 
duty. It's the interests of the country as a whole that he's got to consider 
above everything else." Taggart sat up; of all the danger signs he knew, this 
line of talk was the worst. "Nobody can deny it, Jim, that Wesley feels a 
high regard for you as an enlightened businessman, a valuable adviser and one 
of his closest personal friends." 

Taggart 's eyes shot to him swiftly: this was still worse. "But nobody can 
say that Wesley would hesitate to sacrifice his personal feelings and 
friendships— where the welfare of the public is concerned." 

Taggart 's face remained blank; his terror came from things never allowed 
to reach expression in words or in facial muscles. The terror was his 
struggle against an unadmitted thought: he himself had been "the public" for 
so long and in so many different issues, that he knew what it would mean if 
that magic title, that sacred title no one dared to oppose, were transferred, 
along with its "welfare," to the person of Buzzy Watts. 

But what he asked, and he asked it hastily, was, "You're not implying that 
I would place my personal interests above the public welfare, are you?" 

"No, of course not," said Mr. Weatherby, with a look that was almost a 
smile. "Certainly not. Not you, Jim. Your public-spirited attitude— and 
understanding — are too well known. That's why Wesley expects you to see every 
side of the picture." 

"Yes, of course, " said Taggart, trapped. 

"Well, consider the unions' side of it. Maybe you can't afford to give 
them a raise, but how can they afford to exist when the cost of living has 
shot sky-high? They've got to eat, don't they? That comes first, railroad or 
no railroad." Mr. Weatherby 's tone had a kind of placid righteousness, as if 
he were reciting a formula required to convey another meaning, clear to all 
of them; he was looking straight at Taggart, in special emphasis of the 
unstated. "There are almost a million members in the railway unions. With 
families, dependents and poor relatives— and who hasn't got poor relatives 
these days?— it amounts to about five million votes. Persons, I mean. Wesley 
has to bear that in mind. He has to think of their psychology. And then, 
consider the public. The rates you're charging were established at a time 
when everybody was making money. But the way things are now, the cost of 
transportation has become a burden nobody can afford. People arc screaming 
about it all over the country." He looked straight at Taggart; he merely 
looked, but his glance had the quality of a wink. 

"There's an awful lot of them, Jim. They're not very happy at the moment 
about an awful lot of things. A government that would bring the railroad 
rates down would make a lot of folks grateful." 

The silence that answered him was like a hole so deep that no sound could 
be heard of the things crashing down to its bottom. Taggart knew, as they all 
knew, to what disinterested motive Mr. Mouch would always be ready to 
sacrifice his personal friendships. 

It was the silence and the fact that she did not want to say it, had come 
here resolved not to speak, but could not resist it, that made Dagny's voice 
sound so vibrantly harsh: "Got what you've been asking for, all these years, 
gentlemen?" 

The swiftness with which their eyes moved to her was an involuntary answer 
to an unexpected sound, but the swiftness with which they moved away— to look 
down at the table, at the walls, anywhere but at her— was the conscious answer 
to the meaning of the sounds. 

In the silence of the next moment, she felt their resentment like a starch 
thickening the air of the room, and she knew that it was not resentment 
against Mr. Weatherby, but against her. She could have borne it, if they had 



merely let her question go unanswered; but what made her feel a sickening 
tightness in her stomach, was their double fraud of pretending to ignore her 
and then answering in their own kind of manner. 

The chairman said, not looking at her, his voice pointedly noncommittal, 
yet vaguely purposeful at the same time, "It would have been all right, 
everything would have worked out fine, if it weren't for the wrong people in 
positions of power, such as Buzzy Watts and Chick Morrison." 

"Oh, I wouldn't worry about Chick Morrison," said the pallid man with the 
mustache. "He hasn't any top-level connections. Not really. 

It's Tinky Holloway that's poison." 

"I don't see the picture as hopeless," said a portly man who wore a green 
muffler. "Joe Dunphy and Bud Hazleton are very close to Wesley. If their 
influence prevails, we'll be all right. However, Kip Chalmers and Tinky 
Holloway are dangerous." 

"I can take care of Kip Chalmers," said Taggart. 

Mr. Weatherby was the only person in the room who did not mind looking at 
Dagny; but whenever his glance rested upon her, it registered nothing; she 
was the only person in the room whom he did not see. 

"I am thinking," said Mr. Weatherby casually, looking at Taggart, "that 
you might do Wesley a favor." 

"Wesley knows that he can always count on me." 

"Well, my thought is that if you granted the unions' wage raises— 

we might drop the question of cutting the rates, for the time being." 

"I can't do that!" It was almost a cry. "The National Alliance of 
Railroads has taken a unanimous stand against the raises and has committed 
every member to refuse." 

"That's just what I mean," said Mr. Weatherby softly. "Wesley needs to 
drive a wedge into that Alliance stand. If a railroad like Taggart 
Transcontinental were to give in, the rest would be easy. You would help 
Wesley a great deal. He would appreciate it." 

"But, good God, Clem!— I'd be open to court action for it, by the Alliance 
rules ! " 

Mr. Weatherby smiled. "What court? Let Wesley take care of that." 
"But listen, Clem, you know— you know just as well as I do— that we can't 
afford it!" 

Mr. Weatherby shrugged. "That's a problem for you to work out." 
"How, for Christ's sake?" 

"I don't know. That's your job, not ours. You wouldn't want the government 
to start telling you how to run your railroad, would you?" 
"No, of course not! But—" 

"Our job is only to see that the people get fair wages and decent 
transportation. It's up to you to deliver. But, of course, if you say that 
you can't do the job, why then—" 

"I haven't said it!" Taggart cried hastily, "I haven't said it at all!" 

"Good," said Mr. Weatherby pleasantly. "We know that you have the ability 
to find some way to do it." 

He was looking at Taggart; Taggart was looking at Dagny. 

"Well, it was just a thought," said Mr. Weatherby, leaning back in his 
chair in a manner of modest withdrawal. "Just a thought for you to mull over. 
I'm only a guest here. I don't want to interfere. The purpose of the meeting 
was to discuss the situation of the . . . branch lines, I believe?" 

"Yes," said the chairman and sighed. "Yes. Now if anyone has a 
constructive suggestion to offer—" He waited; no one answered. "I believe the 
picture is clear to all of us." He waited. "It seems to be established that 
we cannot continue to afford the operation of some of our branch lines . . . 
the Rio Norte Line in particular . . . and, therefore, some form of action 
seems to be indicated. ..." 



"I think, " said the pallid man with the mustache, his voice unexpectedly 
confident, "that we should now hear from Miss Taggart." He leaned forward 
with a look of hopeful craftiness. As Dagny did not answer, but merely turned 
to him, he asked, "What do you have to say, Miss Taggart?" 

"Nothing. " 

"I beg your pardon?" 

"All I had to say was contained in the report which Jim has read to you." 
She spoke quietly, her voice clear and flat. 
"But you did not make any recommendations." 
"I have none to make." 

"But, after all, as our Operating Vice-President, you have a vital 
interest in the policies of this railroad." 

"I have no authority over the policies of this railroad." 
"Oh, but we are anxious to consider your opinion." 
"I have no opinions." 

"Miss Taggart, " he said, in the smoothly formal tone of an order, "you 
cannot fail to realize that our branch lines are running at a disastrous 
deficit— and that we expect you to make them pay." 

"How?" 

"I don't know. That is your job, not ours." 

"I have stated in my report the reasons why that is now impossible. 

If there are facts which I have overlooked, please name them." 

"Oh, I wouldn't know. We expect you to find some way to make it possible. 
Our job is only to see that the stockholders get a fair profit. 

It's up to you to deliver. You wouldn't want us to think that you're 
unable to do the job and—" 

"I am unable to do it." 

The man opened his mouth, but found nothing else to say; he looked at her 
in bewilderment, wondering why the formula had failed. 

"Miss Taggart, " asked the man with the green muffler, "did you imply in 
your report that the situation of the Rio Norte Line was critical?" 

"I stated that it was hopeless." 

"Then what action do you propose?" 

"I propose- nothing." 

"Aren't you evading a responsibility?" 

"What is it that you think you're doing?" She spoke evenly, addressing 
them all. "Are you counting on my not saying that the responsibility-is 
yours, that it was your goddamn policies that brought us where we are? Well, 
I ' m saying it . " 

"Miss Taggart, Miss Taggart, " said the chairman in a tone of pleading 
reproach, "there shouldn't be any hard feelings among us. Does it matter now 
who was to blame? We don't want to quarrel over past mistakes. We must all 
pull together as a team to carry our railroad through this desperate 
emergency, " 

A gray-haired man of patrician bearing, who had remained silent throughout 
the session, with a look of the quietly bitter knowledge that the entire 
performance was futile, glanced at Dagny in a way which would have been 
sympathy had he still felt a remnant of hope. He said, raising his voice just 
enough to betray a note of controlled indignation, "Mr. Chairman, if it is 
practical solutions that we are considering, I should like to suggest that we 
discuss the limitation placed upon the length and speed of our trains. Of any 
single practice, that is the most disastrous one. Its repeal would not solve 
all of our problems, but it would be an enormous relief. With the desperate 
shortage of motive power and the appalling shortage of fuel, it is criminal 
insanity to send an engine out on the road with sixty cars when it could pull 
a hundred and to take four days on a run which could be made in three. I 
suggest that we compute the number of shippers we have ruined and the 



districts we have destroyed through the failures, shortages and delays of 
transportation, and then we—" 

"Don't think of it," Mr. Weatherby cut in snappily. "Don't try dreaming 
about any repeals. We wouldn't consider it. We wouldn't even consider 
listening to any talk on the subject." 

"Mr. Chairman," the gray-haired man asked quietly, "shall I continue?" 

The chairman spread out his hands, with a smooth smile, indicating 
helplessness. "It would be impractical," he answered. 

"I think we'd better confine the discussion to the status of the Rio Norte 
Line," snapped James Taggart. 

There was a long silence. 

The man with the green muffler turned to Dagny. "Miss Taggart," he asked 
sadly and cautiously, "would you say that if— this is just a hypothetical 
question— if the equipment now in use on the Rio Norte Line were made 
available, it would fill the needs of our transcontinental main-line 
traffic?" 

"It would help." 

"The rail of the Rio Norte Line, " said the pallid man with the mustache, 
"is unmatched anywhere in the country and could not now be purchased at any 
price. We have three hundred miles of track, which means well over four 
hundred miles of rail of pure Rearden Metal in that Line. Would you say, Miss 
Taggart, that we cannot afford to waste that superlative rail on a branch 
that carries no major traffic any longer?" 

"That is for you to judge." 

"Let me put it this way: would it be of value if that rail were made 
available for our main-line track, which is in such urgent need of repair?" 
"It would help." 

"Miss Taggart, " asked the man with the quavering voice, "would you say 
that there are any shippers of consequence left on the Rio Norte Line?" 
"There's Ted Nielsen of Nielsen Motors. No one else." 

"Would you say that the operating costs of the Rio Norte Line could be 
used to relieve the financial strain on the rest of the system?" 
"It would help." 

"Then, as our Operating Vice-President . . ."He stopped; she waited, 
looking at him; he said, "Well?" 
"What was your question?" 

"I meant to say . . . that is, well, as our Operating Vice-President, 
don't you have certain conclusions to draw?" 

She stood up. She looked at the faces around the table. "Gentlemen," 
she said, "I do not know by what sort of self-fraud you expect to feel 
that if it's I who name the decision you intend to make, it will be I who'll 
bear the responsibility for it. Perhaps you believe that if my voice delivers 
the final blow, it will make me the murderer involved— since you know that 
this is the last act of a long-drawn-out murder. I cannot conceive what it is 
you think you can accomplish by a pretense of this kind, and I will not help 
you to stage it. The final blow will be delivered by you, as were all the 
others . " 

She turned to go. The chairman half-rose, asking helplessly, "But, Miss 
Taggart-" 

"Please remain seated. Please continue the discussion— and take the vote in 
which I shall have no voice. I shall abstain from voting. Ill stand by, if 
you wish me to, but only as an employee. I will not pretend to be anything 
else . " 

She turned away once more, but it was the voice of the gray-haired man 
that stopped her. "Miss Taggart, this is not an official question, it is only 
my personal curiosity, but would you tell me your view of the future of the 
Taggart Transcontinental system?" 



She answered, looking at him in understanding, her voice gentler, "I have 
stopped thinking of a future or of a railroad system. I intend to continue 
running trains so long as it is still possible to run them. I don't think 
that it will be much longer." 

She walked away from the table, to the window, to stand aside and let them 
continue without her. 

She looked at the city. Jim had obtained the permit which allowed them the 
use of electric power to the top of the Taggart Building. 

From the height of the room, the city looked like a flattened remnant, 
with but a few rare, lonely streaks of lighted glass still rising through the 
darkness to the sky. 

She did not listen to the voices of the men behind her. She did not know 
for how long the broken snatches of their struggle kept rolling past her— the 
sounds that nudged and prodded one another, trying to edge back and leave 
someone pushed forward— a struggle, not to assert one's own will, but to 
squeeze an assertion from some unwilling victim —a battle in which the 
decision was to be pronounced, not by the winner, but by the loser: "It seems 
to me ... It is, I think ... It must, in my opinion . . . 

If we were to suppose ... I am merely suggesting ... I am not 
implying, but ... If we consider both sides ... It is, in my opinion, 
indubitable ... It seems to me to be an unmistakable fact . . ." 

She did not know whose voice it was, but she heard it when the voice 
pronounced: ". . . and, therefore, I move that the John Gait Line be closed." 

Something, she thought, had made him call the Line by its right name. 

You had to bear it, too, generations ago— it was just as hard for you, just 
as bad, but you did not let it stop you— was it really as bad as this? as 
ugly?— never mind, it's different forms, but it's only pain, and you were not 
stopped by pain, not by whatever kind it was that you had to bear— you were 
not stopped— you did not give in to it— you faced it and this is the kind I 
have to face— you fought and I will have to —you did it— I will try . . . She 
heard, in her own mind, the quiet intensity of the words of dedication— and it 
was some time before she realized that she was speaking to Nat Taggart. 

The next voice she heard was Mr. Weatherby's: "Wait a minute, boys. 

Do you happen to remember that you need to obtain permission before you 
can close a branch line?" 

"Good God, Clem!" Taggart 's cry was open panic. "Surely there's not going 
to be any trouble about—" 

"I wouldn't be too sure of it. Don't forget that you're a public service 
and you're expected to provide transportation, whether you make money or 
not. " 

"But you know that it's impossible!" 

"Well, that's fine for you, that solves your problem, if you close that 
Line— but what will it do to us? Leaving a whole state like Colorado 
practically without transportation— what sort of public sentiment will it 
arouse? Now, of course, if you gave Wesley something in return, to balance 
it, if you granted the unions' wage raises—" 

"I can't! I gave my word to the National Alliance!" 

"Your word? Well, suit yourself; We wouldn't want to force the Alliance. 
We much prefer to have things happen voluntarily. But these are difficult 
times and it's hard telling what's liable to happen. With everybody going 
broke and the tax receipts falling, we might— fact being that we hold well 
over fifty per cent of the Taggart bonds— we might be compelled to call for 
the payment of railroad bonds within six months." 

"What?!" screamed Taggart. 

"—or sooner." 



"But you can't! Oh God, you can't! It was understood that the moratorium 
was for five years! It was a contract, an obligation! We were counting on 
it! " 

"An obligation? Aren't you old-fashioned, Jim? There aren't any 
obligations, except the necessity of the moment. The original owners of those 
bonds were counting on their payments, too." 

Dagny burst out laughing. 

She could not stop herself, she could not resist it, she could not reject 
a moment's chance to avenge Ellis Wyatt, Andrew Stockton, Lawrence Hammond, 
all the others. She said, torn by laughter: "Thanks, Mr. Weatherby!" 

Mr. Weatherby looked at her in astonishment. "Yes?" he asked coldly. 

"I knew that we would have to pay for those bonds one way or another. 
We ' re paying . " 

"Miss Taggart, " said the chairman severely, "don't you think that I told- 
you-so's are futile? To talk of what would have happened if we had acted 
differently is nothing but purely theoretical speculation. We cannot indulge 
in theory, we have to deal with the practical reality of the moment." 

"Right," said Mr. Weatherby. "That's what you ought to be— practical . Now 
we offer you a trade. You do something for us and we'll do something for you. 
You give the unions their wage raises and we'll give you permission to close 
the Rio Norte Line." 

"All right," said James Taggart, his voice choked. 

Standing at the window, she heard them vote on their decision. She heard 
them declare that the John Gait Line would end in six weeks, on March 31. 

It's only a matter of getting through the next few moments, she thought; 
take care of the next few moments, and then the next, a few at a time, and 
after a while it will be easier; you'll get over it, after a while. 

The assignment she gave herself for the next few moments was to put on her 
coat and be first to leave the room. 

Then there was the assignment of riding in an elevator down the great, 
silent length of the Taggart Building. Then there was the assignment of 
crossing the dark lobby. 

Halfway through the lobby, she stopped. A man stood leaning against the 
wall, in a manner of purposeful waiting— and it was she who was his purpose, 
because he was looking straight at her. She did not recognize him at once, 
because she felt certain that the face she saw could not possibly be there in 
that lobby at this hour. 

"Hi, Slug," he said softly. 

She answered, groping for some great distance that had once been hers, 
"Hi, Frisco." 

"Have they finally murdered John Gait?" 

She struggled to place the moment into some orderly sequence of time. The 
question belonged to the present, but the solemn face came from those days on 
the hill by the Hudson when he would have understood all that the question 
meant to her. 

"How did you know that they'd do it tonight?" she asked. 

"It's been obvious for months that that would be the next step at their 
next meeting." 

"Why did you come here?" 
"To see how you'd take it." 
"Want to laugh about it?" 

"No, Dagny, I don't want to laugh about it." 

She saw no hint of amusement in his face; she answered trustingly, "I 
don't know how I'm taking it." 
"I do." 



"I was expecting it, I knew they'd have to do it, so now it's only a 
matter of getting through"— tonight, she wanted to say, but said— "all the work 
and details." 

He took her arm. "Let's go some place where we can have a drink together." 
"Francisco, why don't you laugh at me? You've always laughed about that 
Line . " 

"I will— tomorrow, when I see you going on with all the work and details. 
Not tonight." 
"Why not?" 

"Come on. You're in no condition to talk about it." 

"I—" She wanted to protest, but said, "No, I guess I'm not." 

He led her out to the street, and she found herself walking silently in 
time with the steady rhythm of his steps, the grasp of his fingers on her arm 
unstressed and firm. He signaled a passing taxicab and held the door open for 
her. She obeyed him without questions; she felt relief, like a swimmer who 
stops struggling. The spectacle of a man acting with assurance, was a life 
belt thrown to her at a moment when she had forgotten the hope of its 
existence. The relief was not in the surrender of responsibility, but in the 
sight of a man able to assume it. 

"Dagny, " he said, looking at the city as it moved past their taxi window, 
"think of the first man who thought of making a steel girder. He knew what he 
saw, what he thought and what he wanted. He did not say, 'It seems to me, ' 
and he did not take orders from those who say, 'In my opinion.'" 

She chuckled, wondering at his accuracy: he had guessed the nature of the 
sickening sense that held her, the sense of a swamp which she had to escape. 

"Look around you," he said. "A city is the frozen shape of human courage— 
the courage of those men who thought for the first time of every bolt, rivet 
and power generator that went to make it. The courage to say, not 'It seems 
to me, ' but 'It is'— and to stake one's life on one's judgment. You're not 
alone. Those men exist. They have always existed. There was a time when human 
beings crouched in caves, at the mercy of any pestilence and any storm. Could 
men such as those on your Board of Directors have brought them out of the 
cave and up to this?" He pointed at the city. 

"God, no!" 

"Then there's your proof that another kind of men do exist." 
"Yes," she said avidly. "Yes." 

"Think of them and forget your Board of Directors." 

"Francisco, where are they now— the other kind of men?" 

"Now they're not wanted." 

"I want them. Oh God, how I want them!" 

"When you do, you'll find them." 

He did not question her about the John Gait Line and she did not speak of 
it, until they sat at a table in a dimly lighted booth and she saw the stem 
of a glass between her fingers. She had barely noticed how they had come 
here. It was a quiet, costly place that looked like a secret retreat; she saw 
a small, lustrous table under her hand, the leather of a circular seat behind 
her shoulders, and a niche of dark blue mirror that cut them off from the 
sight of whatever enjoyment or pain others had come here to hide. Francisco 
was leaning against the table, watching her, and she felt as if she were 
leaning against the steady attentiveness of his eyes. 

They did not speak of the Line, but she said suddenly, looking down at the 
liquid in her glass: "I'm thinking of the night when Nat Taggart was told 
that he had to abandon the bridge he was building. The bridge across the 
Mississippi. He had been desperately short of money— because people were 
afraid of the bridge, they called it an impractical venture. That morning, he 
was told that the river steamboat concerns had filed suit against him, 
demanding that his bridge be destroyed as a threat to the public welfare. 



There were three spans of the bridge built, advancing across the river. That 
same day, a local mob attacked the structure and set fire to the wooden 
scaffolding. His workers deserted him, some because they were scared, some 
because they were bribed by the steamboat people, and most of them because he 
had had no money to pay them for weeks. Throughout that day, he kept 
receiving word that men who had subscribed to buy the stock of the Taggart 
Transcontinental Railroad were cancelling their subscriptions, one after 
another. Toward evening, a committee, representing two banks that were his 
last hope of support, came to see him. It was right there, on the 
construction site by the river, in the old railway coach where he lived, with 
the door open to the view of the blackened ruin, with the wooden remnants 
still smoking over the twisted steel. He had negotiated a loan from those 
banks, but the contract had not been signed. The committee told him that he 
would have to give up his bridge, because he was certain to lose the suit, 
and the bridge would be ordered torn down by the time he completed it. If he 
was willing to give it up, they said, and to ferry his passengers across the 
river on barges, as other railroads were doing, the contract would stand and 
he would get the money to continue his line west on the other shore; if not, 
then the loan was off. What was his answer?— 

they asked. He did not say a word, he picked up the contract, tore it 
across, handed it to them and walked out. He walked to the bridge, along the 
spans, down to the last girder. He knelt, he picked up the tools his men had 
left and he started to clear the charred wreckage away from the steel 
structure. His chief engineer saw him there, axe in hand, alone over the wide 
river, with the sun setting behind him in that west where his line was to go. 
He worked there all night. By morning, he had thought out a plan of what he 
would do to find the right men, the men of independent judgment— to find them, 
to convince them, to raise the money, to continue the bridge." 

She spoke in a low, flat voice, looking down at the spot of light that 
shimmered in the liquid as her fingers turned the stem of her glass once in a 
while. She showed no emotion, but her voice had the intense monotone of a 
prayer: "Francisco . . . if he could live through that night, what right have 
I to complain? What does it matter, how I feel just now? He built that 
bridge, I have to hold it for him. I can't let it go the way of the bridge of 
the Atlantic Southern. I feel almost as if he'd know it, if I let that 
happen, he'd know it that night when he was alone over the river . . . no, 
that's nonsense, but here's what I feel: any man who knows what Nat Taggart 
felt that night, any man living now and capable of knowing it— it's him that I 
would betray if I let it happen . . . and I can't." 

"Dagny, if Nat Taggart were living now, what would he do?" 

She answered involuntarily, with a swift, bitter chuckle, "He wouldn't 
last a minute ! "—then corrected herself: "No, he would. He would find a way to 
fight them." 

"How?" 

"I don't know." 

She noticed some tense, cautious quality in the attentive way he watched 
her as he leaned forward and asked, "Dagny, the men of your Board of 
Directors are no match for Nat Taggart, are they? There's no form of contest 
in which they could beat him, there's nothing he'd have to fear from them, 
there's no mind, no will, no power in the bunch of them to equal one- 
thousandth of his." 

"No, of course not." 

"Then why is it that throughout men's history the Nat Taggarts, who make 
the world, have always won— and always lost it to the men of the Board?" 
"I . . . don't know." 

"How could men who ' re afraid to hold an unqualified opinion about the 
weather, fight Nat Taggart? How could they seize his achievement, if he chose 



to defend it? Dagny, he fought with every weapon he possessed, except the 
most important one. They could not have won, if we —he and the rest of us— had 
not given the world away to them." 

"Yes, You gave it away to them. Ellis Wyatt did. Ken Danagger did, I 
won ' t . " 

He smiled. "Who built the John Gait Line for them?" 

He saw only the faintest contraction of her mouth, but he knew that the 
question was like a blow across an open wound. Yet she answered quietly, "I 
did. " 

"For this kind of end?" 

"For the men who did not hold out, would not fight and gave up." 
"Don't you see that no other end was possible?" 
"No . " 

"How much injustice are you willing to take?" 
"As much as I'm able to fight." 
"What will you do now? Tomorrow?" 

She said calmly, looking straight at him with the faintly proud look of 
stressing her calm, "Start to tear it up." 
"What?" 

"The John Gait Line. Start to tear it up as good as with my own hands— with 
my own mind, by my own instructions. Get it ready to be closed, then tear it 
up and use its pieces to reinforce the transcontinental track. There's a lot 
of work to do. It will keep me busy." The calm cracked a little, in the 
faintest change of her voice: "You know, I'm looking forward to it. I'm glad 
that I'll have to do it myself. 

That's why Nat Taggart worked all that night— just to keep going. It's not 
so bad as long as there's something one can do. And I'll know, at least, that 
I'm saving the main line." 

"Dagny, " he asked very quietly— and she wondered what made her feel that he 
looked as if his personal fate hung on her answer, "what if it were the main 
line that you had to dismember?" 

She answered irresistibly, "Then I'd let the last engine run over me!" 

-but added, "No. That's just self-pity. I wouldn't." 

He said gently, "I know you wouldn't. But you'd wish you could." 

"Yes." 

He smiled, not looking at her; it was a mocking smile, but it was a smile 
of pain and the mockery was directed at himself. She wondered what made her 
certain of it; but she knew his face so well that she would always know what 
he felt, even though she could not guess his reasons any longer. She knew his 
face as well, she thought, as she knew every line of his body, as she could 
still see it, as she was suddenly aware of it under his clothes, a few feet 
away, in the crowding intimacy of the booth. He turned to look at her and 
some sudden change in his eyes made her certain that he knew what she was 
thinking. He looked away and picked up his glass. 

"Well-" he said, "to Nat Taggart." 

"And to Sebastian d'Anconia?" she asked— then regretted it, because it had 
sounded like mockery, which she had not intended. 

But she saw a look of odd, bright clarity in his eyes and he answered 
firmly, with the faintly proud smile of stressing his firmness, "Yes— and to 
Sebastian d'Anconia," 

Her hand trembled a little and she spilled a few drops on the square of 
paper lace that lay on the dark, shining plastic of the table. She watched 
him empty his glass in a single gesture; the brusque, brief movement of his 
hand made it look like the gesture of some solemn pledge. 

She thought suddenly that this was the first time in twelve years that he 
had come to her of his own choice. 



He had acted as if he were confidently in control, as if his confidence 
were a transfusion to let her recapture hers, he had given her no time to 
wonder that they should be here together. Now she felt, unaccountably, that 
the reins he had held were gone. It was only the silence of a few blank 
moments and the motionless outline of his forehead, cheekbone and mouth, as 
he sat with his face turned away from her— 

but she felt as if it were he who was now struggling for something he had 
to recapture. 

She wondered what had been his purpose tonight— and noticed that he had, 
perhaps, accomplished it: he had carried her over the worst moment, he had 
given her an invaluable defense against despair— the knowledge that a living 
intelligence had heard her and understood. But why had he wanted to do it? 
Why had he cared about her hour of despair— after the years of agony he had 
given her? Why had it mattered to him how she would take the death of the 
John Gait Line? She noticed that this was the question she had not asked him 
in the lobby of the Taggart Building. 

This was the bond between them, she thought: that she would never be 
astonished if he came when she needed him most, and that he would always know 
when to come. This was the danger: that she would trust him even while 
knowing that it could be nothing but some new kind of trap, even while 
remembering that he would always betray those who trusted him. 

He sat, leaning forward with his arms crossed on the table, looking 
straight ahead. He said suddenly, not turning to her: "1 am thinking of the 
fifteen years that Sebastian d'Anconia had to wait for the woman he loved. He 
did not know whether he would ever find her again, whether she would survive 
. . . whether she would wait for him. But he knew that she could not live 
through his battle and that he could not call her to him until it was won. So 
he waited, holding his love in the place of the hope which he had no right to 
hold. 

But when he carried her across the threshold of his house, as the first 
Senora d'Anconia of a new world, he knew that the battle was won, that they 
were free, that nothing threatened her and nothing would ever hurt her 
again . " 

In the days of their passionate happiness, he had never given her a hint 
that he would come to think of her as Senora d'Anconia. For one moment, she 
wondered whether she had known what she had meant to him. But the moment 
ended in an invisible shudder: she would not believe that the past twelve 
years could allow the things she was hearing to be possible. This was the new 
trap, she thought. 

"Francisco, " she asked, her voice hard, "what have you done to Hank 
Rearden?" 

He looked startled that she should think of that name at that moment 
"Why?" he asked. 

"He told me once that you were the only man he'd ever liked. But last time 
I saw him, he said that he would kill you on sight." 
"He did not tell you why?" 
"No . " 

"He told you nothing about it?" 

"No." She saw him smiling strangely, a smile of sadness, gratitude and 
longing. "I warned him that you would hurt him— when he told me that you were 
the only man he liked." 

His words came like a sudden explosion: "He was the only man— 

with one exception— to whom I could have given my life!" 

"Who is the exception?" 

"The man to whom I have." 

"What do you mean?" 



He shook his head, as if he had said more than he intended, and did not 
answer . 

"What did you do to Rearden?" 
"I'll tell you some time. Not now." 

"Is that what you always do to those who . . . mean a great deal to you?" 

He looked at her with a smile that had the luminous sincerity of innocence 
and pain. "You know," he said gently, "I could say that that is what they 
always do to me." He added, "But I won't. The actions— and the knowledge— were 
mine . " 

He stood up. "Shall we go? I'll take you home." 

She rose and he held her coat for her; it was a wide, loose garment, and 
his hands guided it to enfold her body. She felt his arm remain about her 
shoulders a moment longer than he intended her to notice. 

She glanced back at him. But he was standing oddly still, staring intently 
down at the table. In rising, they had brushed aside the mats of paper lace 
and she saw an inscription cut into the plastic of the table top. Attempts 
had been made to erase it, but the inscription remained, as the graven voice 
of some unknown drunk's despair: "Who is John Gait?" 

With a brusque movement of anger, she flicked the mat back to cover the 
words. He chuckled. 

"I can answer it," he said. "I can tell you who is John Gait." 

"Really? Everybody seems to know him, but they never tell the same story 
twice . " 

"They're all true, though— all the stories you've heard about him." 
"Well, what's yours? Who is he?" 

"John Gait is Prometheus who changed his mind. After centuries of being 
torn by vultures in payment for having brought to men the fire of the gods, 
he broke his chains and he withdrew his fire— until the day when men withdraw 
their vultures." 

The band of crossties swept in wide curves around granite corners, 
clinging to the mountainsides of Colorado. Dagny walked down the ties, 
keeping her hands in her coat pockets, and her eyes on the meaningless 
distance ahead; only the familiar movement of straining her steps to the 
spacing of the ties gave her the physical sense of an action pertaining to a 
railroad. 

A gray cotton, which was neither quite fog nor clouds, hung in sloppy wads 
between sky and mountains, making the sky look like an old mattress spilling 
its stuffing down the sides of the peaks. A crusted snow covered the ground, 
belonging neither to winter nor to spring. A net of moisture hung in the air, 
and she felt an icy pin-prick on her face once in a while, which was neither 
a raindrop nor a snowflake. 

The weather seemed afraid to take a stand and clung noncommittally to some 
sort of road's middle; Board of Directors' weather, she thought. 

The light seemed drained and she could not tell whether this was the 
afternoon or the evening of March 31. But she was very certain that it was 
March 31; that was a certainty not to be escaped. 

She had come to Colorado with Hank Rearden, to buy whatever machinery 
could still be found in the closed factories. It had been like a hurried 
search through the sinking hulk of a great ship before it was to vanish out 
of reach. They could have given the task to employees, but they had come, 
both prompted by the same unconfessed motive: they could not resist the 
desire to attend the run of the last train, as one cannot resist the desire 
to give a last salute by attending a funeral, even while knowing that it is 
only an act of self-torture. 

They had been buying machinery from doubtful owners in sales of dubious 
legality, since nobody could tell who had the right to dispose of the great, 
dead properties, and nobody would come to challenge the transactions. They 



had bought everything that could be moved from the gutted plant of Nielsen 
Motors. Ted Nielsen had quit and vanished, a week after the announcement that 
the Line was to be closed. 

She had felt like a scavenger, but the activity of the hunt had made her 
able to bear these past few days. When she had found that three empty hours 
remained before the departure of the last train, she had gone to walk through 
the countryside, to escape the stillness of the town. She had walked at 
random through twisting mountain trails, alone among rocks and snow, trying 
to substitute motion for thought, knowing that she had to get through this 
day without thinking of the summer when she had ridden the engine of the 
first train. 

But she found herself walking back along the roadbed of the John Gait 
Line— and she knew that she had intended it, that she had gone out for that 
purpose . 

It was a spur track which had already been dismembered. There were no 
signal lights, no switches, no telephone wires, nothing but a long band of 
wooden strips left on the ground— a chain of ties without rail, like the 
remnant of a spine— and, as its lonely guardian, at an abandoned grade 
crossing, a pole with slanted arms saying: "Stop. 

Look. Listen." 

An early darkness mixed with fog was slipping down to fill the valleys, 
when she came upon the factory. There was an inscription high on the lustrous 
tile of its front wall: "Roger Marsh. Electrical Appliances." The man who had 
wanted to chain himself to his desk in order not to leave this, she thought. 
The building stood intact, like a corpse in that instant when its eyes have 
just closed and one still waits to see them open again. She felt that the 
lights would flare up at any moment behind the great sheets of windows, under 
the long, flat roofs. Then she saw one broken pane, pierced by a stone for 
some young moron's en j oyment— and she saw the tall, dry stem of a single weed 
rising from the steps of the main entrance. Hit by a sudden, blinding hatred, 
in rebellion against the weed's impertinence, knowing of what enemy this was 
the scout, she ran forward, she fell on her knees and jerked the weed up by 
its roots. Then, kneeling on the steps of a closed factory, looking at the 
vast silence of mountains, brush and dusk, she thought: What do you think 
you're doing? 

It was almost dark when she reached the end of the ties that led her back 
to the town of Marshville. Marshville had been the end of the Line for months 
past; service to Wyatt Junction had been discontinued long ago; Dr. Ferris' 
Reclamation Project had been abandoned this winter. 

The street lights were on, and they hung in mid-air at the intersections, 
in a long, diminishing line of yellow globes over the empty streets of 
Marshville. All the better homes were closed— the neat, sturdy houses of 
modest cost, well built and well kept; there were faded "For Sale" signs on 
their lawns. But she saw lights in the windows of the cheap, garish 
structures that had acquired, within a few years, the slovenly dilapidation 
of slum hovels; the homes of people who had not moved, the people who never 
looked beyond the span of one week. She saw a large new television set in the 
lighted room of a house with a sagging roof and cracking walls. She wondered 
how long they expected the electric power companies of Colorado to remain in 
existence. Then she shook her head: those people had never known that power 
companies existed. 

The main street of Marshville was lined by the black windows of shops out 
of business. All the luxury stores are gone— she thought, looking at their 
signs; and then she shuddered, realizing what things she now called luxury, 
realizing to what extent and in what manner those things, once available to 
the poorest, had been luxuries: Dry Cleaning— Electrical Appliances— Gas 



Station— Drug Store— Five and Ten. The only ones left open were grocery stores 
and saloons. 

The platform of the railroad station was crowded. The glaring arc lights 
seemed to pick it out of the mountains, to isolate and focus it, like a small 
stage on which every movement was naked to the sight of the unseen tiers 
rising in the vast, encircling night. People were carting luggage, bundling 
their children, haggling at ticket windows, the stifled panic of their manner 
suggesting that what they really wanted to do was to fall down on the ground 
and scream with terror. Their terror had the evasive quality of guilt: it was 
not the fear that comes from understanding, but from the refusal to 
understand. 

The last train stood at the platform, its windows a long, lone streak of 
light. The steam of the locomotive, gasping tensely through the wheels, did 
not have its usual joyous sound of energy released for a sprint; it had the 
sound of a panting breath that one dreads to hear and dreads more to stop 
hearing. Far at the end of the lighted windows, she saw the small red dot of 
a lantern attached to her private car. Beyond the lantern, there was nothing 
but a black void. 

The train was loaded to capacity, and the shrill notes of hysteria in the 
confusion of voices were the pleas for space in vestibules and aisles. Some 
people were not leaving, but stood in vapid curiosity, watching the show; 
they had come, as if knowing that this was the last event they would ever 
witness in their community and, perhaps, in their lives. 

She walked hastily through the crowd, trying not to look at anyone. 

Some knew who she was, most of them did not. She saw an old woman with a 
ragged shawl on her shoulders and the graph of a lifetime's struggle on the 
cracked skin of her face; the woman's glance was a hopeless appeal for help. 
An unshaved young man with gold-rimmed glasses stood on a crate under an arc 
light, yelling to the faces shifting past him, "What do they mean, no 
business! Look at that train! It's full of passengers! There's plenty of 
business! It's just that there's no profits for them— that ' s why they're 
letting you perish, those greedy parasites!" A disheveled woman rushed up to 
Dagny, waving two tickets and screaming something about the wrong date. Dagny 
found herself pushing people out of the way, fighting to reach the end of the 
train— but an emaciated man, with the staring eyes of years of malicious 
futility, rushed at her, shouting, "It's all right for you, you've got a good 
overcoat and a private car, but you won't give us any trains, you and all the 
selfish—" 

He stopped abruptly, looking at someone behind her. She felt a hand 
grasping her elbow: it was Hank Rearden. He held her arm and led her toward 
her car; seeing the look on his face, she understood why people got out of 
their way. At the end of the platform, a pallid, plumpish man stood saying to 
a crying woman, "That's how it's always been in this world. There will be no 
chance for the poor, until the rich are destroyed." High above the town, 
hanging in black space like an uncooled planet, the flame of Wyatt ' s Torch 
was twisting in the wind. 

Rearden went inside her car, but she remained on the steps of the 
vestibule, delaying the finality of turning away. She heard the "All aboard!" 
She looked at the people who remained on the platform as one looks at those 
who watch the departure of the last lifeboat. 

The conductor stood below, at the foot of the steps, with his lantern in 
one hand and his watch in the other. He glanced at the watch, then glanced up 
at her face. She answered by the silent affirmation of closing her eyes and 
inclining her head. She saw his lantern circling through the air, as she 
turned away— and the first jolt of the wheels, on the rails of Rearden Metal, 
was made easier for her by the sight of Rearden, as she pulled the door open 
and went into her car. 



When James Taggart telephoned Lillian Rearden from New York and said, 
"Why, no— no special reason, just wondered how you were and whether you ever 
came to the city— haven't seen you for ages and just thought we might have 
lunch together next time you're in New York"— she knew that he had some very 
special reason in mind. 

When she answered lazily, "Oh, let me see— what day is this? April second?— 
let me look at my calendar— why, it just so happens that I have some shopping 
to do in New York tomorrow, so I'll be delighted to let you save me my lunch 
money"— he knew that she had no shopping to do and that the luncheon would be 
the only purpose of her trip to the city. 

They met in a distinguished, high-priced restaurant, much too 
distinguished and high-priced ever to be mentioned in the gossip columns; not 
the kind of place which James Taggart, always eager for personal publicity, 
was in the habit of patronizing; he did not want them to be seen together, 
she concluded. 

The half-hint of half-secret amusement remained on her face while she 
listened to him talking about their friends, the theater and the weather, 
carefully building for himself the protection of the unimportant. She sat 
gracefully not quite straight, as if she were leaning back, enjoying the 
futility of his performance and the fact that he had to stage it for her 
benefit. She waited with patient curiosity to discover his purpose. 

"I do think that you deserve a pat on the back or a medal or something, 
Jim," she said, "for being remarkably cheerful in spite of all the messy 
trouble you're having. Didn't you just close the best branch of your 
railroad? " 

"Oh, it's only a slight financial setback, nothing more. One has to expect 
retrenchments at a time like this. Considering the general state of the 
country, we're doing quite well. Better than the rest of them." He added, 
shrugging, "Besides, it's a matter of opinion whether the Rio Norte Line was 
our best branch. It is only my sister who thought so. 

It was her pet project." 

She caught the tone of pleasure blurring the drawl of his syllables. 
She smiled and said, "I see." 

Looking up at her from under his lowered forehead, as if stressing that he 
expected her to understand, Taggart asked, "How is he taking it?" 
"Who?" She understood quite well. 
"Your husband." 
"Taking what?" 
"The closing of that Line." 

She smiled gaily. "Your guess is as good as mine, Jim— and mine is very 
good indeed, " 

"What do you mean?" 

"You know how he would take it— just as you know how your sister is taking 
it. So your cloud has a double silver lining, hasn't it?" 
"What has he been saying in the last few days?" 

"He's been away in Colorado for over a week, so I—" She stopped; she had 
started answering lightly, but she noticed that Taggart ' s question had been 
too specific while his tone had been too casual, and she realized that he had 
struck the first note leading toward the purpose of the luncheon; she paused 
for the briefest instant, then finished, still more lightly, "so I wouldn't 
know. But he's coming back any day now." 

"Would you say that his attitude is still what one might call 
recalcitrant? " 

"Why, Jim, that would be an understatement!" 

"It was to be hoped that events had, perhaps, taught him the wisdom of a 
mellower approach." 



It amused her to keep him in doubt about her understanding. "Oh yes," she 
said innocently, "it would be wonderful if anything could ever make him 
change . " 

"He is making things exceedingly hard for himself." 
"He always has." 

"But events have a way of beating us all into a more . . . pliable frame 
of mind, sooner or later." 

"I've heard many characteristics ascribed to him, but 'pliable' has never 
been one of them." 

"Well, things change and people change with them. After all, it is a law 
of nature that animals must adapt themselves to their background. 

And I might add that adaptability is the one characteristic most 
stringently required at present by laws other than those of nature. We're in 
for a very difficult time, and I would hate to see you suffer the 
consequences of his intransigent attitude. I would hate— as your friend— to see 
you in the kind of danger he's headed for, unless he learns to cooperate." 

"How sweet of you, Jim," she said sweetly. 

He was doling his sentences out with cautious slowness, balancing himself 
between word and intonation to hit the right degree of semi clarity. He 
wanted her to understand, but he did not want her to understand fully, 
explicitly, down to the root— since the essence of that modern language, which 
he had learned to speak expertly, was never to let oneself or others 
understand anything down to the root. 

He had not needed many words to understand Mr. Weatherby. On his last trip 
to Washington, he had pleaded with Mr. Weatherby that a cut in the rates of 
the railroads would be a deathblow; the wage raises had been granted, but the 
demands for the cut in rates were still heard in the press— and Taggart had 
known what it meant, if Mr. Mouch still permitted them to be heard; he had 
known that the knife was still poised at his throat. Mr. Weatherby had not 
answered his pleas, but had said, in a tone of idly irrelevant speculation, 
"Wesley has so many tough problems. If he is to give everybody a breathing 
spell, financially speaking, he's got to put into operation a certain 
emergency program of which you have some inkling. But you know what hell the 
unprogressive elements of the country would raise about it. A man like 
Rearden, for instance. We don't want any more stunts of the sort he's liable 
to pull. Wesley would give a lot for somebody who could keep Rearden in line. 
But I guess that's something nobody can deliver. 

Though I may be wrong. You may know better, Jim, since Rearden is a sort 
of friend of yours, who comes to your parties and all that." 

Looking at Lillian across the table, Taggart said, "Friendship, I find, is 
the most valuable thing in life— and I would be amiss if I didn't give you 
proof of mine." 

"But I've never doubted it." 

He lowered his voice to the tone of an ominous warning: "I think I should 
tell you, as a favor to a friend, although it's confidential, that your 
husband's attitude is being discussed in high places— very high places. I'm 
sure you know what I mean." 

This was why he hated Lillian Rearden, thought Taggart: she knew the game, 
but she played it with unexpected variations of her own. It was against all 
rules to look at him suddenly, to laugh in his face, and —after all those 
remarks showing that she understood too little— to say bluntly, showing that 
she understood too much, "Why, darling, of course I know what you mean. You 
mean that the purpose of this very excellent luncheon was not a favor you 
wanted to do me, but a favor you wanted to get from me. You mean that it's 
you who are in danger and could use that favor to great advantage for a trade 
in high places. 



And you mean that you are reminding me of my promise to deliver the 
goods . " 

"The sort of performance he put on at his trial was hardly what I'd call 
delivering the goods," he said angrily. "It wasn't what you had led me to 
expect . " 

"Oh my, no, it wasn't," she said placidly. "It certainly wasn't. But, 
darling, did you expect me not to know that after that performance of his he 
wouldn't be very popular in high places? Did you really think you had to tell 
me that as a confidential favor?" 

"But it's true. I heard him discussed, so I thought I'd tell you." 

"I'm sure it's true. I know that they would be discussing him. I know also 
that if there were anything they could do to him, they would have done it 
right after his trial. My, would they have been glad to do it! So I know that 
he's the only one among you who is in no danger whatever, at the moment. I 
know that it's they who are afraid of him. Do you see how well I understand 
what you mean, darling?" 

"Well, if you think you do, I must say that for my part I don't understand 
you at all. I don't know what it is you're doing." 

"Why, I'm just setting things straight— so that you'll know that I know how 
much you need me. And now that it's straight, I'll tell you the truth in my 
turn: I didn't double-cross you, I merely failed. His performance at the 
trial— I didn't expect it any more than you did. 

Less. I had good reason not to expect it. But something went wrong. 

I don't know what it was. I am trying to find out. When I do, I will keep 
my promise. Then you'll be free to take full credit for it and to tell your 
friends in high places that it's you who've disarmed him." 

"Lillian," he said nervously, "I meant it when I said that I was anxious 
to give you proof of my friendship— so if there's anything-1 can do for—" 

She laughed. "There isn't. I know you meant it. But there's nothing you 
can do for me. No favor of any kind. No trade. I'm a truly noncommercial 
person, I want nothing in return. Tough luck, Jim. You'll just have to remain 
at my mercy . " 

"But then why should you want to do it at all? What are you getting out of 
it?" 

She leaned back, smiling. "This lunch. Just seeing you here. Just knowing 
that you had to come to me." 

An angry spark flashed in Taggart ' s veiled eyes, then his eyelids narrowed 
slowly and he, too, leaned back in his chair, his face relaxing to a faint 
look of mockery and satisfaction. Even from within that unstated, unnamed, 
undefined muck which represented his code of values, he was able to realize 
which one of them was the more dependent on the other and the more 
contemptible . 

When they parted at the door of the restaurant, she went to Rearden's 
suite at the Wayne-Falkland Hotel, where she stayed occasionally in his 
absence. She paced the room for about half an hour, in a leisurely manner of 
reflection. Then she picked up the telephone, with a smoothly casual gesture, 
but with the purposeful air of a decision reached. She called Rearden's 
office at the mills and asked Miss Ives when she expected him to return. 

"Mr. Rearden will be in New York tomorrow, arriving on the Comet, Mrs. 
Rearden, " said Miss Ives' clear, courteous voice. 

"Tomorrow? That's wonderful. Miss Ives, would you do me a favor? 

Would you call Gertrude at the house and tell her not to expect me for 
dinner? I'm staying in New York overnight." 

She hung up, glanced at her watch and called the florist of the Wayne- 
Falkland. "This is Mrs. Henry Rearden," she said. "I should like to have two 
dozen roses delivered to Mr. Rearden's drawing room aboard the Comet. . . . 



Yes, today, this afternoon, when the Comet reaches Chicago. . . . No, without 
any card— just the flowers. . . . 
Thank you ever so much." 

She telephoned James Taggart. "Jim, will you send me a pass to your 
passenger platforms? I want to meet my husband at the station tomorrow." 

She hesitated between Balph Eubank and Bertram Scudder, chose Balph 
Eubank, telephoned him and made a date for this evening's dinner and a 
musical show. Then she went to take a bathl, and lay relaxing in a tub of 
warm water, reading a magazine devoted to problems of political economy. 

It was late afternoon when the florist telephoned her. "Our Chicago office 
sent word that they were unable to deliver the flowers, Mrs. 

Rearden, " he said, "because Mr. Rearden is not aboard the Comet." 

"Are you sure?" she asked. 

"Quite sure, Mrs. Rearden. Our man found at the station in Chicago that 
there was no compartment on the train reserved in Mr. Rearden 's name. We 
checked with the New York office of Taggart Transcontinental, just to make 
certain, and were told that Mr. Rearden' s name is not on the passenger list 
of the Comet . " 

"I see. . . . Then cancel the order, please. . . . Thank you." 

She sat by the telephone for a moment, frowning, then called Miss Ives. 
"Please forgive me for being slightly scatterbrained, Miss Ives, but I was 
rushed and did not write it down, and now I'm not quite certain of what you 
said. Did you say that Mr. Rearden was coming back tomorrow? On the Comet?" 

"Yes, Mrs. Rearden." 

"You have not heard of any delay or change in his plans?" 

"Why, no. In fact, I spoke to Mr. Rearden about an hour ago. He telephoned 
from the station in Chicago, and he mentioned that he had to hurry back 
aboard, as the Comet was about to leave." 

"I see. Thank you." 

She leaped to her feet as soon as the click of the instrument restored her 
to privacy. She started pacing the room, her steps now unrhythmically tense. 
Then she stopped, struck by a sudden thought. 

There was only one reason why a man would make a train reservation under 
an assumed name: if he was not traveling alone. 

Her facial muscles went flowing slowly into a smile of satisfaction: this 
was an opportunity she had not expected. 

Standing on the Terminal platform, at a point halfway down the length of 
the train, Lillian Rearden watched the passengers descending from the Comet. 
Her mouth held the hint of a smile; there was a spark of animation in her 
lifeless eyes; she glanced from one face to another, jerking her head with 
the awkward eagerness of a schoolgirl. 

She was anticipating the look on Rearden 's face when, with his mistress 
beside him, he would see her standing there. 

Her glance darted hopefully to every flashy young female stepping off the 
train. It was hard to watch: within an instant after the first few figures, 
the train had seemed to burst at the seams, flooding the platform with a 
solid current that swept in one direction, as if pulled by a vacuum; she 
could barely distinguish separate persons. The lights were more glare than 
illumination, picking this one strip out of a dusty, oily darkness. She 
needed an effort to stand still against the invisible pressure of motion. 

Her first sight of Rearden in the crowd came as a shock: she had not seen 
him step out of a car, but there he was, walking in her direction from 
somewhere far down the length of the train. He was alone. He was walking with 
his usual purposeful speed, his hands in the pockets of his trenchcoat. There 
was no woman beside him, no companion of any kind, except a porter hurrying 
along with a bag she recognized as his. 



In a fury of incredulous disappointment, she looked frantically for any 
single feminine figure he could, have left behind. She felt certain that she 
would recognize his choice. She saw none that could be possible. And then she 
saw that the last car of the train was a private car, and that the figure 
standing at its door, talking to some station official— 

a figure wearing, not minks and veils, but a rough sports coat that 
stressed the incomparable grace of a slender body in the confident posture of 
this station's owner and center— was Dagny Taggart. Then Lillian Rearden 
understood . 

"Lillian! What's the matter?" 

She heard Rearden 's voice, she felt his hand grasping her arm, she saw him 
looking at her as one looks at the object of a sudden emergency. He was 
looking at a blank face and an unfocused glance of terror. 

"What happened? What are you doing here?" 

"I . . . Hello, Henry ... I just came to meet you ... No special 
reason ... I just wanted to meet you." The terror was gone from her face, 
but she spoke in a strange, flat voice. "I wanted to see you, it was an 
impulse, a sudden impulse and I couldn't resist it, because—" 

"But you look . . . looked ill." 

"No . . . No, maybe I felt faint, it's stuffy here. ... I couldn't 
resist coming, because it made me think of the days when you would have been 
glad to see me ... it was a moment's illusion to recreate for myself. . . 
. " The words sounded like a memorized lesson. 

She knew that she had to speak, while her mind was fighting to grasp the 
full meaning of her discovery. The words were part of the plan she had 
intended to use, if she had met him after he had found the roses in his 
compartment . 

He did not answer, he stood watching her, frowning. 

"I missed you, Henry, I know what I am confessing. But I don't expect it 
to mean anything to you any longer." The words did not fit the tight face, 
the lips that moved with effort, the eyes that kept glancing away from him 
down the length of the platform. "I wanted ... I merely wanted to surprise 
you." A look of shrewdness and purpose was returning to her face. 

He took her arm, but she drew back, a little too sharply. 

"Aren't you going to say a word to me, Henry?" 

"What do you wish me to say?" 

"Do you hate it as much as that— having your wife come to meet you at the 
station?" She glanced down the platform: Dagny Taggart was walking toward 
them; he did not see her. 

"Let's go," he said. 

She would not move. "Do you?" she asked. 
"What?" 

"Do you hate it?" 

"No, I don't hate it. I merely don't understand it." 

"Tell me about your trip. I'm sure you've had a very enjoyable trip." 
"Come on. We can talk at home." 

"When do I ever have a chance to talk to you at home?" She was drawling 
her words impassively, as if she were stretching them to fill time, for some 
reason which he could not imagine. "I had hoped to catch a few moments of 
your attention— like this— between trains and business appointments and all 
those important matters that hold you day and night, all those great 
achievements of yours, such as . . . 

Hello, Miss Taggart!" she said sharply, her voice loud and bright. 

Rearden whirled around. Dagny was walking past them, but she stopped. 

"How do you do," she said to Lillian, bowing, her face expressionless. 

"I am so sorry, Miss Taggart, " said Lillian, smiling, "you must forgive me 
if I don't know the appropriate formula of condolences for the occasion." She 



noted that Dagny and Rearden had not greeted each other. "You're returning 
from what was, in effect, the funeral of your child by my husband, aren't 
you?" 

Dagny 's mouth showed a faint line of astonishment and of contempt. 

She inclined her head, by way of leave-taking, and walked on. 

Lillian glanced sharply at Rearden 's face, as if in deliberate emphasis. 
He looked at her indifferently, puzzled. 

She said nothing. She followed him without a word when he turned to go. 
She remained silent in the taxicab, her face half-turned away from him, while 
they rode to the Wayne-Falkland Hotel. He felt certain, as he looked at the 
tautly twisted set of her mouth, that some uncustomary violence was raging 
within her. He had never known her to experience a strong emotion of any 
kind . 

She whirled to face him, the moment they were alone in his room. 
"So that's who it is?" she asked. 

He had not expected it. He looked at her, not quite believing that he had 
understood it correctly. 

"It's Dagny Taggart who's your mistress, isn't she?" 
He did not answer. 

"I happen to know that you had no compartment on that train. So I know 
where you've slept for the last four nights. Do you want to admit it or do 
you want me to send detectives to question her train crews and her house 
servants? Is it Dagny Taggart?" 

"Yes," he answered calmly. 

Her mouth twisted into an ugly chuckle; she was staring past him. 
"I should have known it. I should have guessed. That's why it didn't 
work ! " 

He asked, in blank bewilderment, "What didn't work?" 

She stepped back, as if to remind herself of his presence. "Had you— 
when she was in our house, at the party— had you, then . . . ?" 
"No. Since." 

"The great businesswoman, " she said, "above reproach and feminine 
weaknesses. The great mind detached from any concern with the body . . ." She 
chuckled, "The bracelet . . ." she said, with the still look that made it 
sound as if the words were dropped accidentally out of the torrent in her 
mind. "That's what she meant to you. That's the weapon she gave you." 

"If you really understand what you're saying— yes." 

"Do you think I'll let you get away with it?" 

"Get away . . . ?" He was looking at her incredulously, in cold, 
astonished curiosity. 

"That's why, at your trial—" She stopped. 
"What about my trial?" 

She was trembling. "You know, of course, that I won't allow this to 
continue . " 

"What does it have to do with my trial?" 

"I won't permit you to have her. Not her. Anyone but her." 
He let a moment pass, then asked evenly, "Why?" 

"I won't permit it! You'll give it up!" He was looking at her without 
expression, but the steadiness of his eyes hit her as his most dangerous 
answer. "You'll give it up, you'll leave her, you'll never see her again!" 

"Lillian, if you wish to discuss it, there's one thing you'd better 
understand; nothing on earth will make me give it up." 

"But I demand it!" 

"I told you that you could demand anything but that." 

He saw the look of a peculiar panic growing in her eyes: it was not the 
look of understanding, but of a ferocious refusal to understand— as if she 
wanted to turn the violence of her emotion into a fog screen, as if she 



hoped, not that it would blind her to reality, but that her blindness would 
make reality cease to exist. 

"But I have the right to demand it! I own your life! It's my property. 

My property— by your own oath. You swore to serve my happiness, Not yours— 
mine! What have you done for me? You've given me nothing, you've sacrificed 
nothing, you've never been concerned with anything but yourself— your work, 
your mills, your talent, your mistress! 

What about me? I hold first claim! I'm presenting it for collection! 

You're the account I own!" 

It was the look on his face that drove her up the rising steps of her 
voice, scream by scream, into terror. She was seeing, not anger or pain or 
guilt, but the one inviolate enemy: indifference. 

"Have you thought of me?" she screamed, her voice breaking against his 
face. "Have you thought of what you're doing to me? You have no right to go 
on, if you know that you're putting me through hell every time you sleep with 
that woman! I can't stand it, I can't stand one moment of knowing it! Will 
you sacrifice me to your animal desire? Are you as vicious and selfish as 
that? Can you buy your pleasure at the price of my suffering? Can you have 
it, if this is what it does to me?" 

Feeling nothing but the emptiness of wonder, he observed the thing which 
he had glimpsed briefly in the past and was now seeing in the full ugliness 
of its futility: the spectacle of pleas for pity delivered, in snarling 
hatred, as threats and as demands. 

"Lillian," he said very quietly, "I would have it, even if it took your 
life. " 

She heard it. She heard more than he was ready to know and to hear in his 
own words. The shock, to him, was that she did not scream in answer, but that 
he saw her, instead, shrinking down into calm. "You have no right . . ." she 
said dully. It had the embarrassing helplessness of the words of a person who 
knows her own words to be meaningless. 

"Whatever claim you may have on me, " he said, "no human being can hold on 
another a claim demanding that he wipe himself out of existence." 

"Does she mean as much as that to you?" 

"Much more than that." 

The look of thought was returning to her face, but in her face it had the 
quality of a look of cunning. She remained silent. 

"Lillian, I'm glad that you know the truth. Now you can make a choice with 
full understanding. You may divorce me— or you may ask that we continue as we 
are. That is the only choice you have. It is all I can offer you. I think you 
know that I want you to divorce me. But I don't ask for sacrifices. I don't 
know what sort of comfort you can find in our marriage, but if you do, I 
won't ask you to give it up. I don't know why you should want to hold me now, 
I don't know what it is that I mean to you, I don't know what you're seeking, 
what form of happiness is yours or what you will obtain from a situation 
which I see as intolerable for both of us. By every standard of mine, you 
should have divorced me long ago. By every standard of mine, to maintain our 
marriage will be a vicious fraud. But my standards are not yours. I do not 
understand yours, I never have, but I will accept them. If this is the manner 
of your love for me, if bearing the name of my wife will give you some form 
of contentment, I won't take it away from you. It's I who've broken my word, 
so I will atone for it to the extent I can. You know, of course, that I could 
buy one of those modern judges and obtain a divorce any time I wished. I 
won't do it. I will keep my word, if you so desire, but this is the only form 
in which I can keep it. Now make your choice— but if you choose to hold me, 
you must never speak to me about her, you must never show her that you know, 
if you meet her in the future, you must never touch that part of my life." 



She stood still, looking up at him, the posture of her body slouched and 
loose, as if its sloppiness were a form of defiance, as if she did not care 
to resume for his sake the discipline of a graceful bearing. 

"Miss Dagny Taggart . . . " she said, and chuckled. "The superwoman whom 
common, average wives were not supposed to suspect. 

The woman who cared for nothing but business and dealt with men as a man. 
The woman of great spirit who admired you platonically, just for your genius, 
your mills and your Metal!" She chuckled. "I should have known that she was 
just a bitch who wanted you in the same way as any bitch would want you— 
because you are fully as expert in bed as you are at a desk, if I am a judge 
of such matters. But she would appreciate that better than I, since she 
worships expertness of any kind and since she has probably been laid by every 
section hand on her railroad!" 

She stopped, because she saw, for the first time in her life, by what sort 
of look one learns that a man is capable of killing. But he was not looking 
at her. She was not sure whether he was seeing her at all or hearing her 
voice . 

He was hearing his own voice saying her words— saying them to Dagny in the 
sun-striped bedroom of Ellis Wyatt ' s house. He was seeing, in the nights 
behind him, Dagny 's face in those moments when, his body leaving hers, she 
lay still with a look of radiance that was more than a smile, a look of 
youth, of early morning, of gratitude to the fact of one's own existence. And 
he was seeing Lillian's face, as he had seen it in bed beside him, a lifeless 
face with evasive eyes, with some feeble sneer on its lips and the look of 
sharing some smutty guilt. He saw who was the accuser and who the accused— he 
saw the obscenity of letting impotence hold itself as virtue and damn the 
power of living as a sin- 
he saw, with the clarity of direct perception, in the shock of a single 
instant, the terrible ugliness of that which had once been his own belief. 

It was only an instant, a conviction without words, a knowledge grasped as 
a feeling, left unsealed by his mind. The shock brought him back to the sight 
of Lillian and to the sound of her words. She appeared to him suddenly as 
some inconsequential presence that had to be dealt with at the moment. 

"Lillian, " he said, in an unstressed voice that did not grant her even the 
honor of anger, "you are not to speak of her to me. If you ever do it again, 
I will answer you as I would answer a hoodlum: I will beat you up. Neither 
you nor anyone else is to discuss her." 

She glanced at him. "Really?" she said. It had an odd, casual sound —as if 
the word were tossed away, leaving some hook implanted in her mind. She 
seemed to be considering some sudden vision of her own. 

He said quietly, in weary astonishment, "I thought you would be glad to 
discover the truth. I thought you would prefer to know— for the sake of 
whatever love or respect you felt for me— that if I betrayed you, it was not 
cheaply and casually, it was not for a chorus girl, but for the cleanest and 
most serious feeling of my life." 

The ferocious spring with which she whirled to him was involuntary, as was 
the naked twist of hatred in her face. "Oh, you goddamn fool!" 

He remained silent. 

Her composure returned, with the faint suggestion of a smile of secret 
mockery. "I believe you're waiting for my answer?" she said. "No, I won't 
divorce you. Don't ever hope for that. We shall continue as we are— if that is 
what you offered and if you think it can continue. See whether you can flout 
all moral principles and get away with it!" 

He did not listen to her while she reached for her coat, telling him that 
she was going back to their home. He barely noticed it when the door closed 
after her. He stood motionless, held by a feeling he had never experienced 
before. He knew that he would have to think later, to think and understand, 



but for the moment he wanted nothing but to observe the wonder of what he 
felt. 

It was a sense of freedom, as if he stood alone in the midst of an endless 
sweep of clean air, with only the memory of some weight that had been torn 
off his shoulders. It was the feeling of an immense deliverance. It was the 
knowledge that it did not matter to him what Lillian felt, what she suffered 
or what became of her, and more: not only that it did not matter, but the 
shining, guiltless knowledge that it did not have to matter. 



CHAPTER VI 
MIRACLE METAL 



"But can we get away with it?" asked Wesley Mouch. His voice was high with 
anger and thin with fear. 

Nobody answered him. James Taggart sat on the edge of an armchair, not 
moving, looking up at him from under his forehead, Orren Boyle gave a vicious 
tap against an ashtray, shaking the ash off his cigar. Dr. 

Floyd Ferris smiled. Mr. Weatherby folded his lips and hands. Fred Kinnan, 
head of the Amalgamated Labor of America, stopped pacing the office, sat down 
on the window sill and crossed his arms. Eugene Lawson, who had sat hunched 
downward, absent-mindedly rearranging a display of flowers on a low glass 
table, raised his torso resentfully and glanced up. Mouch sat at his desk, 
with his fist on a sheet of paper. 

It was Eugene Lawson who answered. "That's not, it seems to me, the way to 
put it. We must not let vulgar difficulties obstruct our feeling that it's a 
noble plan motivated solely by the public welfare. It's for the good of the 
people. The people need it. Need comes first, so we don't have to consider 
anything else." 

Nobody objected or picked it up; they looked as if Lawson had merely made 
it harder to continue the discussion. But a small man who sat unobtrusively 
in the best armchair of the room, apart from the others, content to be 
ignored and fully aware that none of them could be unconscious of his 
presence, glanced at Lawson, then at Mouch, and said with brisk cheerfulness, 
"That's the line, Wesley. Tone it down and dress it up and get your press 
boys to chant it— and you won't have to worry." 

"Yes, Mr. Thompson," said Mouch glumly. 

Mr. Thompson, the Head of the State, was a man who possessed the quality 
of never being noticed. In any group of three, his person became 
indistinguishable, and when seen alone it seemed to evoke a group of its own, 
composed of the countless persons he resembled. 

The country had no clear image of what he looked like: his photographs had 
appeared on the covers of magazines as frequently as those of his 
predecessors in office, but people could never be quite certain which 
photographs were his and which were pictures of "a mail clerk" 

or "a white-collar worker, " accompanying articles about the daily life of 
the undifferentiated— except that Mr. Thompson's collars were usually wilted. 
He had broad shoulders and a slight body. He had stringy hair, a wide mouth 
and an elastic age range that made him look like a harassed forty or an 
unusually vigorous sixty. Holding enormous official powers, he schemed 
ceaselessly to expand them, because it was expected of him by those who had 
pushed him into office. He had the cunning of the unintelligent and the 
frantic energy of the lazy. The sole secret of his rise in life was the fact 
that he was a product of chance and knew it and aspired to nothing else. 

"It's obvious that measures have to be taken. Drastic measures," 

said James Taggart, speaking, not to Mr. Thompson, but to Wesley Mouch. 
"We can't let things go the way they're going much longer." 

His voice was belligerent and shaky. 

"Take it easy, Jim," said Orren Boyle. 

"Something's got to be done and done fast!" 

"Don't look at me," snapped Wesley Mouch. "I can't help it. I can't help 
it if people refuse to co-operate. I'm tied. I need wider powers." 

Mouch had summoned them all to Washington, as his friends and personal 
advisers, for a private, unofficial conference on the national crisis. But, 
watching him, they were unable to decide whether his manner was overbearing 
or whining, whether he was threatening them or pleading for their help. 



"Fact is," said Mr. Weatherby primly, in a statistical tone of voice, 
"that in the twelve-month period ending on the first of this year, the rate 
of business failures has doubled, as compared with the preceding twelve-month 
period. Since the first of this year, it has trebled." 

"Be sure they think it's their own fault," said Dr. Ferris casually. 

"Huh?" said Wesley Mouch, his eyes darting to Ferris. 

"Whatever you do, don't apologize," said Dr, Ferris. "Make them feel 
guilty. " 

"I'm not apologizing!" snapped Mouch. "I'm not to blame. I need wider 
powers . " 

"But it is their own fault, " said Eugene Lawson, turning aggressively to 
Dr. Ferris. "It's their lack of social spirit. They refuse to recognize that 
production is not a private choice, but a public duty. They have no right to 
fail, no matter what conditions happen to come up. They've got to go on 
producing. It's a social imperative. A man's work is not a personal matter, 
it's a social matter. There's no such thing as a personal matter— or a 
personal life. That's what we've got to force them to learn." 

"Gene Lawson knows what I'm talking about," said Dr. Ferris, with a slight 
smile, "even though he hasn't the faintest idea that he does." 

"What do you think you mean?" asked Lawson, his voice rising. 

"Skip it," ordered Wesley Mouch. 

"I don't care what you decide to do, Wesley," said Mr. Thompson, "and I 
don't care if the businessmen squawk about it. Just be sure you've got the 
press with you. Be damn sure about that." 

"I've got 'em," said Mouch. 

"One editor who'd open his trap at the wrong time could do us more harm 
than ten disgruntled millionaires." 

"That's true, Mr. Thompson," said Dr. Ferris. "But can you name one editor 
who knows it?" 

"Guess not," said Mr. Thompson; he sounded pleased. 

"Whatever type of men we're counting on and planning for," said Dr. 
Ferris, "there's a certain old-fashioned quotation which we may safely 
forget: the one about counting on the wise and the honest. We don't have to 
consider them. They're out of date." 

James Taggart glanced at the window. There were patches of blue in the sky 
above the spacious streets of Washington, the faint blue of mid-April, and a 
few beams breaking through the clouds, A monument stood shining in the 
distance, hit by a ray of sun: it was a tall, white obelisk, erected to the 
memory of the man Dr. Ferris was quoting, the man in whose honor this city 
had been named. James Taggart looked away. 

"I don't like the professor's remarks," said Lawson loudly and sullenly. 

"Keep still," said Wesley Mouch. "Dr. Ferris is not talking theory, but 
practice . " 

"Well, if you want to talk practice," said Fred Kinnan, "then let me tell 
you that we can't worry about businessmen at a time like this. 

What we've got to think about is jobs. More jobs for the people. In my 
unions, every man who's working is feeding five who aren't, not counting his 
own pack of starving relatives. If you want my advice— 

oh, I know you won't go for it, but it's just a thought— issue a directive 
making it compulsory to add, say, one-third more men to every payroll in the 
country . " 

"Good God!" yelled Taggart. "Are you crazy? We can barely meet our 
payrolls as it is! There's not enough work for the men we've got now! One- 
third more? We wouldn't have any use for them whatever!" 

"Who cares whether you'd have any use for them?" said Fred Kinnan. "They 
need jobs. That's what comes first— need— doesn ' t it?— 

not your profits." 



"It's not a question of profits!" yelled Taggart hastily. "I haven't said 
anything about profits. I haven't given you any grounds to insult me. 

It's just a question of where in hell we'd get the money to pay your men— 
when half our trains are running empty and there's not enough freight to fill 
a trolley car." His voice slowed down suddenly to a tone of cautious 
thoughtf ulness : "However, we do understand the plight of the working men, 
and— it's just a thought —we could, perhaps, take on a certain extra number, 
if we were permitted to double our freight rates, which—" 

"Have you lost your mind?" yelled Orren Boyle. "I'm going broke on the 
rates you're charging now, I shudder every time a damn boxcar pulls in or out 
of the mills, they're bleeding me to death, I can't afford it— and you want to 
double it?" 

"It is not essential whether you can afford it or not, " said Taggart 
coldly, "You have to be prepared to make some sacrifices. The public needs 
railroads. Need conies first— above your profits." 

"What profits?" yelled Orren Boyle. "When did I ever make any profits? 
Nobody can accuse me of running a profit-making business! 

Just look at my balance sheet— and then look at the books of a certain 
competitor of mine, who's got all the customers, all the raw materials, all 
the technical advantages and a monopoly on secret formulas— then tell me who's 
the profiteer! . . . But, of course, the public does need railroads, and 
perhaps I could manage to absorb a certain raise in rates, if I were to get- 
it's just a thought— if I were to get a subsidy to carry me over the next year 
or two, until I catch my stride and—" 

"What? Again?" yelled Mr. Weatherby, losing his primness. "How many loans 
have you got from us and how many extensions, suspensions and moratoriums? 
You haven't repaid a penny— and with all of you boys going broke and the tax 
receipts crashing, where do you expect us to get the money to hand you a 
subsidy? " 

"There are people who aren't broke," said Boyle slowly. "You boys have no 
excuse for permitting all that need and misery to spread through the country— 
so long as there are people who aren't broke." 

"I can't help it!" yelled Wesley Mouch. "I can't do anything about it! 

I need wider powers ! " 

They could not tell what had prompted Mr. Thompson to attend this 
particular conference. He had said little, but had listened with interest. It 
seemed as if there were something which he had wanted to learn, and now he 
looked as if he had learned it. He stood up and smiled cheerfully. 

"Go ahead, Wesley," he said. "Go ahead with Number 10-289. You won't have 
any trouble at all, " 

They had all risen to their feet, in gloomily reluctant deference. Wesley 
Mouch glanced down at his sheet of paper, then said in a petulant tone of 
voice, "If you want me to go ahead, you'll have to declare a state of total 
emergency . " 

"I'll declare it any time you're ready." 

"There are certain difficulties, which—" 

"I'll leave it up to you. Work it out any way you wish. It's your job. 

Let me see the rough draft, tomorrow or next day, but don't bother me 
about the details. I've got a speech to make on the radio in half an hour." 

"The chief difficulty is that I'm not sure whether the law actually grants 
us the power to put into effect certain provisions of Directive Number 10- 
289.1 fear they might be open to challenge." 

"Oh hell, we've passed so many emergency laws that if you hunt through 
them, you're sure to dig up something that will cover it." 

Mr. Thompson turned to the others with a smile of good fellowship. 

"I'll leave you boys to iron out the wrinkles," he said. "I appreciate 
your coming to Washington to help us out. Glad to have seen you." 



They waited until the door closed after him, then resumed their seats; 
they did not look at one another. 

They had not heard the text of Directive No. 10-289, but they knew what it 
would contain. They had known it for a long time, in that special manner 
which consisted of keeping secrets from oneself and leaving knowledge 
untranslated into words. And, by the same method, they now wished it were 
possible for them not to hear the words of the directive. It was to avoid 
moments such as this that all the complex twistings of their minds had been 
devised, They wished the directive to go into effect. They wished it could be 
put into effect without words, so that they would not have to know that what 
they were doing was what it was. Nobody had ever announced that Directive No. 
10-289 was the final goal of his efforts. 

Yet, for generations past, men had worked to make it possible, and for 
months past, every provision of it had been prepared for by countless 
speeches, articles, sermons, editorials— by purposeful voices that screamed 
with anger if anyone named their purpose. 

'The picture now is this," said Wesley Mouch. "The economic condition of 
the country was better the year before last than it was last year, and last 
year it was better than it is at present. It's obvious that we would not be 
able to survive another year of the same progression. 

Therefore, our sole objective must now be to hold the line. To stand still 
in order to catch our stride. To achieve total stability. Freedom has been 
given a chance and has failed. Therefore, more stringent controls are 
necessary. Since men are unable and unwilling to solve their problems 
voluntarily, they must be forced to do it." He paused, picked up the sheet of 
paper, then added in a less formal tone of voice, "Hell, what it comes down 
to is that we can manage to exist as and where we are, but we can't afford to 
move! So we've got to stand still. We've got to stand still. We've got to 
make those bastards stand still!" 

His head drawn into his shoulders, he was looking at them with the anger 
of a man declaring that the country's troubles were a personal affront to 
him. So many men seeking favors had been afraid of him that he now acted as 
if his anger were a solution to everything, as if his anger were omnipotent, 
as if all he had to do was to get angry. 

Yet, facing him, the men who sat in a silent semicircle before his desk 
were uncertain whether the presence of fear in the room was their own emotion 
or whether the hunched figure behind the desk generated the panic of a 
cornered rat. 

Wesley Mouch had a long, square face and a flat-topped skull, made more so 
by a brush haircut. His lower lip was a petulant bulb and the pale, brownish 
pupils of his eyes looked like the yolks of eggs smeared under the not fully 
translucent whites. His facial muscles moved abruptly, and the movement 
vanished, having conveyed no expression. 

No one had ever seen him smile. 

Wesley Mouch came from a family that had known neither poverty nor wealth 
nor distinction for many generations; it had clung, however, to a tradition 
of its own: that of being college-bred and, therefore, of despising men who 
were in business. The family's diplomas had always hung on the wall in the 
manner of a reproach to the world, because the diplomas had not automatically 
produced the material equivalents of their attested spiritual value. Among 
the family's numerous relatives, there was one rich uncle. He had married his 
money and, in his widowed old age, he had picked Wesley as his favorite from 
among his many nephews and nieces, because Wesley was the least distinguished 
of the lot and therefore, thought Uncle Julius, the safest. Uncle Julius did 
not care for people who were brilliant. He did not care for the trouble of 
managing his money, either; so he turned the job over to Wesley. By the time 
Wesley graduated from college, there was no money left to manage. Uncle 



Julius blamed it on Wesley's cunning and cried that Wesley was an 
unscrupulous schemer. 

But there had been no scheme about it; Wesley could not have said just 
where the money had gone. In high school, Wesley Mouch had been one of the 
worst students and had passionately envied those who were the best. College 
taught him that he did not have to envy them at all. After graduation, he 
took a job in the advertising department of a company that manufactured a 
bogus corn-cure. The cure sold well and he rose to be the head of his 
department. He left it to take charge of the advertising of a hair-restorer, 
then of a patented brassiere, then of a new soap, then of a soft drink— and 
then he became advertising vice-president of an automobile concern. He tried 
to sell automobiles as if they were a bogus corn-cure. They did not sell. 

He blamed it on the insufficiency of his advertising budget. It was the 
president of the automobile concern who recommended him to Rearden. It was 
Rearden who introduced him to Washington— Rearden, who knew no standard by 
which to judge the activities of his Washington man. It was James Taggart who 
gave him a start in the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources— in 
exchange for double crossing Rearden in order to help Orren Boyle in exchange 
for destroying Dan Conway. From then on, people helped Wesley Mouch to 
advance, for the same reason as that which had prompted Uncle Julius: they 
were people who believed that mediocrity was safe. The men who now sat in 
front of his desk had been taught that the law of causality was a 
superstition and that one had to deal with the situation of the moment 
without considering its cause. By the situation of the moment, they had 
concluded that Wesley Mouch was a man of superlative skill and cunning, since 
millions aspired to power, but he was the one who had achieved it. It was not 
within their method of thinking to know that Wesley Mouch was the zero at the 
meeting point of forces unleashed in destruction against one another. 

"This is just a rough draft of Directive Number 10-289," said Wesley 
Mouch, "which Gene, Clem and I have dashed off just to give you the general 
idea. We want to hear your opinions, suggestions and so forth— you being the 
representatives of labor, industry, transportation and the professions." 

Fred Rinnan got off the window sill and sat down on the arm of a chair. 
Orren Boyle spit out the butt of his cigar. James Taggart looked down at his 
own hands. Dr. Ferris was the only one who seemed to be at ease. 

"In the name of the general welfare, " read Wesley Mouch, "to protect the 
people's security, to achieve full equality and total stability, it is 
decreed for the duration of the national emergency that— 

"Point One. All workers, wage earners and employees of any kind whatsoever 
shall henceforth be attached to their jobs and shall not leave nor be 
dismissed nor change employment, under penalty of a term in jail. The penalty 
shall be determined by the Unification Board, such Board to be appointed by 
the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources. All persons reaching 
the age of twenty-one shall report to the Unification Board, which shall 
assign them to where, in its opinion, their services will best serve the 
interests of the nation. 

"Point Two. All industrial, commercial, manufacturing and business 
establishments of any nature whatsoever shall henceforth remain in operation, 
and the owners of such establishments shall not quit nor leave nor retire, 
nor close, sell or transfer their business, under penalty of the 
nationalization of their establishment and of any and all of their property. 

"Point Three. All patents and copyrights, pertaining to any devices, 
inventions, formulas, processes and works of any nature whatsoever, shall be 
turned over to the nation as a patriotic emergency gift by means of Gift 
Certificates to be signed voluntarily by the owners of all such patents and 
copyrights. The Unification Board shall then license the use of such patents 
and copyrights to all applicants, equally and without discrimination, for the 



purpose of eliminating monopolistic practices, discarding obsolete products 
and making the best available to the whole nation. No trademarks, brand names 
or copyrighted titles shall be used. Every formerly patented product shall be 
known by a new name and sold by all manufacturers under the same name, such 
name to be selected by the Unification Board. All private trademarks and 
brand names are hereby abolished. 

"Point Four. No new devices, inventions, products, or goods of any nature 
whatsoever, not now on the market, shall be produced, invented, manufactured 
or sold after the date of this directive. The Office of Patents and 
Copyrights is hereby suspended. 

"Point Five. Every establishment, concern, corporation or person engaged 
in production of any nature whatsoever shall henceforth produce the same 
amount of goods per year as it, they or he produced during the Basic Year, no 
more and no less. The year to be known as the Basic or Yardstick Year is to 
be the year ending on the date of this directive. Over or under production 
shall be fined, such fines to be determined by the Unification Board. 

"Point Six. Every person of any age, sex, class or income, shall 
henceforth spend the same amount of money on the purchase of goods per year 
as he or she spent during the Basic Year, no more and no less. 

Over or under purchasing shall be fined, such fines to be determined by 
the Unification Board. 

"Point Seven. All wages, prices, salaries, dividends, profits, interest 
rates and forms of income of any nature whatsoever, shall be frozen at their 
present figures, as of the date of this directive. 

"Point Eight. All cases arising from and rules not specifically provided 
for in this directive, shall be settled and determined by the Unification 
Board, whose decisions will be final." 

There was, even within the four men who had listened, a remnant of human 
dignity, which made them sit still and feel sick for the length of one 
minute . 

James Taggart spoke first. His voice was low, but it had the trembling 
intensity of an involuntary scream: "Well, why not? Why should they have it, 
if we don't? Why should they stand above us? If we are to perish, let's make 
sure that we all perish together. Let's make sure that we leave them no 
chance to survive ! " 

"That's a damn funny thing to say about a very practical plan that will 
benefit everybody, " said Orren Boyle shrilly, looking at Taggart in 
frightened astonishment. 

Dr. Ferris chuckled. 

Taggart ' s eyes seemed to focus, and he said, his voice louder, "Yes, of 
course. It's a very practical plan. It's necessary, practical and just. 

It will solve everybody's problems. It will give everybody a chance to 
feel safe. A chance to rest." 

"It will give security to the people, " said Eugene Lawson, his mouth 
slithering into a smile. "Security— that ' s what the people want. If they want 
it, why shouldn't they have it? Just because a handful of rich will object?" 

"It's not the rich who'll object," said Dr. Ferris lazily. "The rich drool 
for security more than any other sort of animal— haven ' t you discovered that 
yet?" 

"Well, who'll object?" snapped Lawson. 

Dr. Ferris smiled pointedly, and did not answer. 

Lawson looked away. "To hell with them! Why should we worry about them? 
We've got to run the world for the sake of the little people. It's 
intelligence that's caused all the troubles of humanity. Man's mind is the 
root of all evil. This is the day of the heart. It's the weak, the meek, the 
sick and the humble that must be the only objects of our concern," His lower 
Up was twisting in soft, lecherous motions. 



"Those who ' re big are here to serve those who aren't. If they refuse to do 
their moral duty, we've got to force them. There once was an Age of Reason, 
but we've progressed beyond it. This is the Age of Love." 

"Shut up!" screamed James Taggart. 

They all stared at him. "For Christ's sake, Jim, what's the matter?" 
said Orren Boyle, shaking. 

"Nothing," said Taggart, "nothing . . . Wesley, keep him still, will you?" 

Mouch said uncomfortably, "But I fail to see—" 

"Just keep him still. We don't have to listen to him, do we?" 

"Why, no, but-" 

"Then let's go on." 

"What is this?" demanded Lawson, "I resent it. I most emphatically—" But 
he saw no support in the faces around him and stopped, his mouth sagging into 
an expression of pouting hatred. 

"Let's go on," said Taggart feverishly. 

"What's the matter with you?" asked Orren Boyle, trying not to know what 
was the matter with himself and why he felt frightened. 

"Genius is a superstition, Jim," said Dr. Ferris slowly, with an odd kind 
of emphasis, as if knowing that he was naming the unnamed in all their minds. 
"There's no such thing as the intellect. A man's brain is a social product. A 
sum of influences that he's picked up from those around him. Nobody invents 
anything, he merely reflects what's floating in the social atmosphere. A 
genius is an intellectual scavenger and a greedy hoarder of the ideas which 
rightfully belong to society, from which he stole them. All thought is theft. 
If we do away with private fortunes, we'll have a fairer distribution of 
wealth. If we do away with the genius, we'll have a faker distribution of 
ideas . " 

"Are we here to talk business or are we here to kid one another?" 
asked Fred Kinnan. 

They turned to him. He was a muscular man with large features, but his 
face had the astonishing property of finely drawn lines that raised the 
corners of his mouth into the permanent hint of a wise, sardonic grin. He sat 
on the arm of the chair, hands in pockets, looking at Mouch with the smiling 
glance of a hardened policeman at a shoplifter. 

"All I've got to say is that you'd better staff that Unification Board 
with my men," he said. "Better make sure of it, brother— or I'll blast your 
Point One to hell." 

"I intend, of course, to have a representative of labor on that Board, " 
said Mouch dryly, "as well as a representative of industry, of the 
professions and of every cross-section of—" 

"No cross-sections," said Fred Kinnan evenly. "Just representatives of 
labor. Period." 

"What the hell!" yelled Orren Boyle. "That's stacking the cards, isn't 
it?" 

"Sure," said Fred Kinnan. 

"But that will give you a stranglehold on every business in the country!" 
"What do you think I'm after?" 

"That's unfair!" yelled Boyle. "I won't stand for it! You have no right! 
You-" 

"Right?" said Kinnan innocently. "Are we talking about rights?" 
"But, I mean, after all, there are certain fundamental property rights 
which—" 

"Listen, pal, you want Point Three, don't you?" 
"Well, I-" 

"Then you'd better keep your trap shut about property rights from now on. 
Keep it shut tight." 



"Mr. Kinnan, " said Dr. Ferris, "you must not make the old fashioned 
mistake of drawing wide generalizations. Our policy has to be flexible. There 
are no absolute principles which—" 

"Save it for Jim Taggart, Doc," said Fred Kinnan. "I know what I'm talking 
about. That's because I never went to college." 

"I object," said Boyle, "to your dictatorial method of—" 

Kinnan turned his back on him and said, "Listen, Wesley, my boys won't 
like Point One. If I get to run things, I'll make them swallow it. If not, 
not. Just make up your mind," 

"Well—" said Mouch, and stopped. 

"For Christ's sake, Wesley, what about us?" yelled Taggart. 

"You'll come to me," said Kinnan, "when you'll need a deal to fix the 
Board. But I'll run that Board. Me and Wesley." 

"Do you think the country will stand for it?" yelled Taggart. 

"Stop kidding yourself," said Kinnan. "The country? If there aren't any 
principles any more— and I guess the doc is right, because there sure aren't— 
if there aren't any rules to this game and it's only a question of who robs 
whom— then I've got more votes than the bunch of you, there are more workers 
than employers, and don't you forget it, boys!" 

"That's a funny attitude to take," said Taggart haughtily, "about a 
measure which, after all, is not designed for the selfish benefit of workers 
or employers, but for the general welfare of the public." 

"Okay," said Kinnan amiably, "let's talk your lingo. Who is the public? If 
you go by quality— then it ain't you, Jim, and it ain't Orrie Boyle. If you go 
by quantity— then it sure is me, because quantity is what I've got behind me." 
His smile disappeared, and with a sudden, bitter look of weariness he added, 
"Only I'm not going to say that I'm working for the welfare of my public, 
because I know I'm not. I know that I'm delivering the poor bastards into 
slavery, and that's all there is to it. And they know it, too. But they know 
that I'll have to throw them a crumb once in a while, if I want to keep my 
racket, while with the rest of you they wouldn't have a chance in hell. So 
that's why, if they've got to be under a whip, they'd rather I held it, not 
you— you drooling, tear- j erking, mealy-mouthed bastards of the public welfare! 

Do you think that outside of your college-bred pansies there's one village 
idiot whom you're fooling? I'm a racketeer— but I know it and my boys know it, 
and they know that I'll pay off. Not out of the kindness of my heart, either, 
and not a cent more than I can get away with, but at least they can count on 
that much. Sure, it makes me sick sometimes, it makes me sick right now, but 
it's not me who's built this kind of world— you did— so I'm playing the game as 
you've set it up and I'm going to play it for as long as it lasts— which isn't 
going to be long for any of us ! " 

He stood up. No one answered him. He let his eyes move slowly from face to 
face and stop on Wesley Mouch. 

"Do I get the Board, Wesley?" he asked casually. 

"The selection of the specific personnel is only a technical detail," 
said Mouch pleasantly. "Suppose we discuss it later, you and I?" 
Everybody in the room knew that this meant the answer Yes. 

"Okay, pal," said Kinnan. He went back to the window, sat down on the sill 
and lighted a cigarette. 

For some unadmitted reason, the others were looking at Dr. Ferris, as if 
seeking guidance. 

"Don't be disturbed by oratory," said Dr. Ferris smoothly. "Mr. 

Kinnan is a fine speaker, but he has no sense of practical reality. He is 
unable to think dialectically . " 

There was another silence, then James Taggart spoke up suddenly. 



"I don't care. It doesn't matter. He'll have to hold things still. 
Everything will have to remain as it is. Just as it is. Nobody will be 
permitted to change anything. Except—" He turned sharply to Wesley Mouch. 

"Wesley, under Point Four, we'll have to close all research departments, 
experimental laboratories, scientific foundations and all the rest of the 
institutions of that kind. They'll have to be forbidden." 

"Yes, that's right," said Mouch. "I hadn't thought of that. We'll have to 
stick in a couple of lines about that." He hunted around for a pencil and 
made a few scrawls on the margin of his paper. 

"It will end wasteful competition," said James Taggart. "We'll stop 
scrambling to beat one another to the untried and the unknown. We won't have 
to worry about new inventions upsetting the market. We won't have to pour 
money down the drain in useless experiments just to keep up with over 
ambitious competitors." 

"Yes," said Orren Boyle. "Nobody should be allowed to waste money on the 
new until everybody has plenty of the old. Close all those damn research 
laboratories— and the sooner, the better." 

"Yes," said Wesley Mouch. "We'll close them. All of them." 

"The State Science Institute, too?" asked Fred Kinnan. 

"Oh, no!" said Mouch. "That's different. That's government. Besides, it's 
a non-profit institution. And it will be sufficient to take care of all 
scientific progress." 

"Quite sufficient," said Dr. Ferris. 

"And what will become of all the engineers, professors and such, when you 
close all those laboratories?" asked Fred Kinnan. "What are they going to do 
for a living, with all the other jobs and businesses frozen?" 

"Oh," said Wesley Mouch. He scratched his head. He turned to Mr. 

Weatherby. "Do we put them on relief, Clem?" 

"No," said Mr. Weatherby. "What for? There's not enough of them to raise a 
squawk. Not enough to matter." 

"I suppose," said Mouch, turning to Dr. Ferris, "that you'll be able to 
absorb some of them, Floyd?" 

"Some," said Dr. Ferris slowly, as if relishing every syllable of his 
answer. "Those who prove co-operative." 

"What about the rest?" asked Fred Kinnan. 

"They'll have to wait till the Unification Board finds some use for them," 
said Wesley Mouch. 

"What will they eat while they're waiting?" 

Mouch shrugged. "There's got to be some victims in times of national 
emergency. It can't be helped." 

"We have the right to do it!" cried Taggart suddenly, in defiance to the 
stillness of the room. "We need it. We need it, don't we?" There was no 
answer. "We have the right to protect our livelihood!" Nobody opposed him, 
but he went on with a shrill, pleading insistence. "We'll be safe for the 
first time in centuries. Everybody will know his place and job, and everybody 
else's place and job— and we won't be at the mercy of every stray crank with a 
new idea. Nobody will push us out of business or steal our markets or 
undersell us or make us obsolete. 

Nobody will come to us offering some damn new gadget and putting us on the 
spot to decide whether we'll lose our shirt if we buy it, or whether we'll 
lose our shirt if we don't but somebody else does! We won't have to decide. 
Nobody will be permitted to decide anything. 

It will be decided once and for all." His glance moved pleadingly from 
face to face. "There's been enough invented already— enough for everybody's 
comfort— why should they be allowed to go on inventing? 

Why should we permit them to blast the ground from under our feet every 
few steps? Why should we be kept on the go in eternal uncertainty? Just 



because of a few restless, ambitious adventurers? Should we sacrifice the 
contentment of the whole of mankind to the greed of a few non-conformists? We 
don't need them. We don't need them at all. 

I wish we'd get rid of that hero worship! Heroes? They've done nothing but 
harm, all through history. They've kept mankind running a wild race, with no 
breathing spell, no rest, no ease, no security. Running to catch up with them 
. . . always, without end . . . Just as -we catch up, they're years ahead. . 
. . They leave us no chance . . . They've never left us a chance. ..." His 
eyes were moving restlessly; he glanced at the window, but looked hastily 
away: he did not want to see the white obelisk in the distance. "We're 
through with them. We've won. This is our age. Our world. We're going to have 
security— for the first time in centuries— for the first time since the 
beginning of the industrial revolution!" 

"Well, this, I guess," said Fred Kinnan, "is the anti-industrial 
revolution . " 

"That's a damn funny thing for you to say!" snapped Wesley Mouch. "We 
can't be permitted to say that to the public." 

"Don't worry, brother. I won't say it to the public." 

"It's a total fallacy," said Dr. Ferris. "It's a statement prompted by 
ignorance. Every expert has conceded long ago that a planned economy achieves 
the maximum of productive efficiency and that centralization leads to super- 
industrialization. " 

"Centralization destroys the blight of monopoly," said Boyle. 

"How's that again?" drawled Kinnan. 

Boyle did not catch the tone of mockery, and answered earnestly, "It 
destroys the blight of monopoly. It leads to the democratization of industry. 
It makes everything available to everybody. Now, for instance, at a time like 
this, when there's such a desperate shortage of iron ore, is there any sense 
in my wasting money, labor and national resources on making old-fashioned 
steel, when there exists a much better metal that I could be making? A metal 
that everybody wants, but nobody can get. Now is that good economics or sound 
social efficiency or democratic justice? Why shouldn't I be allowed to 
manufacture that metal and why shouldn't the people get it when they need it? 

Just because of the private monopoly of one selfish individual? Should we 
sacrifice our rights to his personal interests?" 

"Skip it, brother," said Fred Kinnan. "I've read it all in the same 
newspapers you did." 

"I don't like your attitude," said Boyle, in a sudden tone of 
righteousness, with a look which, in a barroom, would have signified a 
prelude to a fist fight. He sat up straight, buttressed by the columns of 
paragraphs on yellow-tinged paper, which he was seeing in his mind: "At a 
time of crucial public need, are we to waste social effort on the manufacture 
of obsolete products? Are we to let the many remain in want while the few 
withhold from us the better products and methods available? Are we to be 
stopped by the superstition of patent rights?" 

"Is it not obvious that private industry is unable to cope with the 
present economic crisis? How long, for instance, are we going to put up with 
the disgraceful shortage of Rearden Metal? There is a crying public demand 
for it, which Rearden has failed to supply." 

"When are we going to put an end to economic injustice and special 
privileges? Why should Rearden be the only one permitted to manufacture 
Rearden Metal?" 

"I don't like your attitude," said Orren Boyle. "So long as we respect the 
rights of the workers, we'll want you to respect the rights of the 
industrialists . " 

"Which rights of which industrialists?" drawled Kinnan. 



"I'm inclined to think," said Dr. Ferris hastily, "that Point Two, 
perhaps, is the most essential one of all at present. We must put an end to 
that peculiar business of industrialists retiring and vanishing. We must stop 
them. It's playing havoc with our entire economy." 

"Why are they doing it?" asked Taggart nervously. "Where are they all 
going? " 

"Nobody knows," said Dr. Ferris. "We've been unable to find any 
information or explanation. But it must be stopped. In times of crisis, 
economic service to the nation is just as much of a duty as military service. 
Anyone who abandons it should be regarded as a deserter. I have recommended 
that we introduce the death penalty for those men, but Wesley wouldn't agree 
to it." 

"Take it easy, boy," said Fred Kinnan in an odd, slow voice. He sat 
suddenly and perfectly still, his arms crossed, looking at Ferris in a manner 
that made it suddenly real to the room that Ferris had proposed murder. 
"Don't let me hear you talk about any death penalties in industry." 

Dr. Ferris shrugged. 

"We don't have to go to extremes," said Mouch hastily. "We don't want to 
frighten people. We want to have them on our side. Our top problem is, will 
they . . . will they accept it at all?" 

"They will," said Dr. Ferris. 

"I'm a little worried," said Eugene Lawson, "about Points Three and Four. 
Taking over the patents is fine. Nobody's going to defend industrialists. But 
I'm worried about taking over the copyrights. That's going to antagonize the 
intellectuals. It's dangerous. It's a spiritual issue. Doesn't Point Four 
mean that no new books are to be written or published from now on?" 

"Yes," said Mouch, "it does. But we can't make an exception for the book- 
publishing business. It's an industry like any other. When we say 'no new 
products, ' it's got to mean 'no new products. ' " 

"But this is a matter of the spirit, " said Lawson; his voice had a tone, 
not of rational respect, but of superstitious awe. 

"We're not interfering with anybody's spirit. But when you print a book on 
paper, it becomes a material commodity— and if we grant an exception to one 
commodity, we won't be able to hold the others in line and we won't be able 
to make anything stick." 

"Yes, that's true. But-" 

"Don't be a chump, Gene," said Dr. Ferris. "You don't want some 
recalcitrant hacks to come out with treatises that will wreck our entire 
program, do you? If you breathe the word 'censorship' now, they'll all scream 
bloody murder. They're not ready for it— as yet. But if you leave the spirit 
alone and make it a simple material issue— not a matter of ideas, but just a 
matter of paper, ink and printing presses— 

you accomplish your purpose much more smoothly. You'll make sure that 
nothing dangerous gets printed or heard— and nobody is going to fight over a 
material issue." 

"Yes, but . . . but I don't think the writers will like it." 

"Are you sure?" asked Wesley Mouch, with a glance that was almost a smile, 
"Don't forget that under Point Five, the publishers will have to publish as 
many books as they did in the Basic Year. Since there will be no new ones, 
they will have to reprint— and the public will have to buy— some of the old 
ones. There are many very worthy books that have never had a fair chance." 

"Oh, " said Lawson; he remembered that he had seen Mouch lunching with 
Balph Eubank two weeks ago. Then he shook his head and frowned. "Still, I'm 
worried. The intellectuals are our friends. We don't want to lose them. They 
can make an awful lot of trouble." 

"They won't," said Fred Kinnan. "Your kind of intellectuals are the first 
to scream when it's safe— and the first to shut their traps at the first sign 



of danger. They spend years spitting at the man who feeds them— and they lick 
the hand of the man who slaps their drooling faces. Didn't they deliver every 
country of Europe, one after another, to committees of goons, just like this 
one here? Didn't they scream their heads off to shut out every burglar alarm 
and to break every padlock open for the goons? Have you heard a peep out of 
them since? Didn't they scream that they were the friends of labor? Do you 
hear them raising their voices about the chain gangs, the slave camps, the 
f ourteen-hour workday and the mortality from scurvy in the People's States of 
Europe? No, but you do hear them telling the whip-beaten wretches that 
starvation is prosperity, that slavery is freedom, that torture chambers arc 
brother-love and that if the wretches don't understand it, then it's their 
own fault that they suffer, and it's the mangled corpses in the jail cellars 
who ' re to blame for all their troubles, not the benevolent leaders! 
Intellectuals? You might have to worry about any other breed of men, but not 
about the modern intellectuals: they'll swallow anything. I don't feel so 
safe about the lousiest wharf rat in the longshoremen's union: he's liable to 
remember suddenly that he is a man— and then I won't be able to keep him in 
line. But the intellectuals? That's the one thing they've forgotten long ago. 
I guess it's the one thing that all their education was aimed to make them 
forget. Do anything you please to the intellectuals. They'll take it." 

"For once," said Dr. Ferns, "I agree with Mr. Kinnan. I agree with his 
facts, if not with his feelings. You don't have to worry about the 
intellectuals, Wesley. Just put a-few of them on the government payroll and 
send them out to preach precisely the sort of thing Mr. 

Kinnan mentioned: that the blame rests on the victims. Give them 
moderately comfortable salaries and extremely loud titles— and they'll forget 
their copyrights and do a better job for you than whole squads of enforcement 
officers . " 

"Yes," said Mouch. "I know." 

"The danger that I'm worried about will come from a different quarter," 
said Dr. Ferris thoughtfully. "You might run into quite a bit of trouble on 
that 'voluntary Gift Certificatel business, Wesley." 

"I know," said Mouch glumly. "That's the point I wanted Thompson to help 
us out on. But I guess he can't. We don't actually have the legal power to 
seize the patents. Oh, there's plenty of clauses in dozens of laws that can 
be stretched to cover it— almost, but not quite. Any tycoon who'd want to make 
a test case would have a very good chance to beat us. And we have to preserve 
a semblance of legality— or the populace won't take it." 

"Precisely," said Dr. Ferris. "It's extremely important to get those 
patents turned over to us voluntarily. Even if we had a law permitting 
outright nationalization, it would be much better to get them as a gift, We 
want to leave to people the illusion that they're still preserving their 
private property rights. And most of them will play along. They'll sign the 
Gift Certificates. Just raise a lot of noise about its being a patriotic duty 
and that anyone who refuses is a prince of greed, and they'll sign. But—" He 
stopped. 

"I know," said Mouch; he was growing visibly more nervous. "There will be, 
I think, a few old-fashioned bastards here and there who'll refuse to sign- 
but they won't be prominent enough to make a noise, nobody will hear about 
it, their own communities and friends will turn against them for their being 
selfish, so it won't give us any trouble. 

We'll just take the patents over, anyway— and those guys won't have the 
nerve or the money to start a test case. But—" He stopped. 

James Taggart leaned back in his chair, watching them; he was beginning to 
enjoy the conversation. 

"Yes," said Dr. Ferris, "I'm thinking of it, too. I'm thinking of a 
certain' tycoon who is in a position to blast us to pieces. Whether we'll 



recover the pieces or not, is hard to tell. God knows what is liable to 
happen at a hysterical time like the present and in a situation as delicate 
as this. Anything can throw everything off balance. Blow up the whole works. 
And if there's anyone who wants to do it, he does. He does and can. He knows 
the real issue, he knows the things which must not be said— and he is not 
afraid to say them. He knows the one dangerous, fatally dangerous weapon. He 
is our deadliest adversary." 
"Who?" asked Lawson. 

Dr. Ferris hesitated, shrugged and answered, "The guiltless man." 

Lawson stared blankly. "What do you mean and whom are you talking about?" 

James Taggart smiled. 

"I mean that there is no way to disarm any man," said Dr. Ferris, "except 
through guilt. Through that which he himself has accepted as guilt. If a man 
has ever stolen a dime, you can impose on him the punishment intended for a 
bank robber and he will take it. He'll bear any form of misery, he'll feel 
that he deserves no better. If there's not enough guilt in the world, we must 
create it. If we teach a man that it's evil to look at spring flowers and he 
believes us and then does it —we'll be able to do whatever we please with 
him. He won't defend himself. He won't feel he's worth it. He won't fight. 
But save us from the man who lives up to his own- standards. Save us from the 
man of clean conscience. He's the man who'll beat us." 

"Are you talking about Henry Rearden?" asked Taggart, his voice peculiarly 
clear . 

The one name they had not wanted to pronounce struck them into an 
instant's silence. 

"What if I were?" asked Dr. Ferris cautiously. 

"Oh, nothing," said Taggart. "Only, if you were, I would tell you that I 
can deliver Henry Rearden. He'll sign." 

By the rules of their unspoken language, they all knew— from the tone of 
his voice— that he was not bluffing. 

"God, Jim! No!" gasped Wesley Mouch. 

"Yes," said Taggart. "I was stunned, too, when I learned— what I learned. I 
didn't expect that. Anything but that." 

"I am glad to hear it," said Mouch cautiously. "It's a constructive piece 
of information. It might be very valuable indeed." 

"Valuable— yes, " said Taggart pleasantly. "When do you plan to put the 
directive into effect?" 

"Oh, we have to move fast. We don't want any news of it to leak out. I 
expect you all to keep this most strictly confidential. I'd say that we'll be 
ready to spring it on them in a couple of weeks." 

"Don't you think that it would be advisable— before all prices are frozen— 
to adjust the matter of the railroad rates? I was thinking of a raise. A 
small but most essentially needed raise." 

"We'll discuss it, you and I," said Mouch amiably. "It might be arranged." 
He turned to the others; Boyle's face was sagging. "There are many details 
still to be worked out, but I'm sure that our program won't encounter any 
major difficulties." He was assuming the tone and manner of a public address; 
he sounded brisk and almost cheerful. "Rough spots are to be expected. If one 
thing doesn't work, we'll try another. 

Trial-and-error is the only pragmatic rule of action. We'll just keep on 
trying. If any hardships come up, remember that it's only temporary. 

Only for the duration of the national emergency." 

"Say, " asked Kinnan, "how is the emergency to end if everything is to 
stand still?" 

"Don't be theoretical," said Mouch impatiently. "We've got to deal with 
the situation of the moment. Don't bother about minor details, so long as the 



broad outlines of our policy are clear. We'll have the power. We'll be able 
to solve any problem and answer any question." 

Fred Kinnan chuckled. "Who is John Gait?" 

"Don't say that!" cried Taggart. 

"I have a question to ask about Point Seven," said Kinnan. "It says that 
al ! wages, prices, salaries, dividends, profits and so forth will be frozen 
on the date of the directive. Taxes, too?" 

"Oh no!" cried Mouch. "How can we tell what funds we'll need in the 
future?" Kinnan seemed to be smiling. "Well?" snapped Mouch. 

"What about it?" 

"Nothing," said Kinnan. "I just asked." 

Mouch leaned back in his chair. "I must say to all of you that I 
appreciate your coming here and giving us the benefit of your opinions. It 
has been very helpful." He leaned forward to look at his desk calendar and 
sat over it for a moment, toying with his pencil, Then the pencil came down, 
struck a date and drew a circle around it. "Directive 10-289 will go into 
effect on the morning of May first." 

All nodded approval. None looked at his neighbor. 

James Taggart rose, walked to the window and pulled the blind down over 
the white obelisk. 

In the first moment of awakening, Dagny was astonished to find herself 
looking at the spires of unfamiliar buildings against a glowing, pale blue 
sky. Then she saw the twisted seam of the thin stocking on her own leg, she 
felt a wrench of discomfort in the muscles of her waistline, and she realized 
that she was lying on the couch in her office, with the clock on her desk 
saying 6:15 and the first rays of the sun giving silver edges to the 
silhouettes of the skyscrapers beyond the window. The last thing she 
remembered was that she had dropped down on the couch, intending to rest for 
ten minutes, when the window was black and the clock stood at 3:30. 

She twisted herself to her feet, feeling an enormous exhaustion. The 
lighted lamp on the desk looked futile in the glow of the morning, over the 
piles of paper which were her cheerless, unfinished task. She tried not to 
think of the work for a few minutes longer, while she dragged herself past 
the desk to her washroom and let handfuls of cold water run over her face. 

The exhaustion was gone by the time she stepped back into the office. No 
matter what night preceded it, she had never known a morning when she did not 
feel the rise of a quiet excitement that became a tightening energy in her 
body and a hunger for action in her mind— 

because this was the beginning of day and it was a day of her life. 

She looked down at the city. The streets were still empty, it made them 
look wider, and in the luminous cleanliness of the spring air they seemed to 
be waiting for the promise of all the greatness that would take form in the 
activity about to pour through them. The calendar in the distance said: May 
1. 

She sat down at her desk, smiling in defiance at the distastef ulness of 
her job. She hated the reports that she had to finish reading, but it was her 
job, it was her railroad, it was morning. She lighted a cigarette, thinking 
that she would finish this task before breakfast; she turned off the lamp and 
pulled the papers forward. 

There were reports from the general managers of the four Regions of the 
Taggart system, their pages a typewritten cry of despair over the breakdowns 
of equipment. There was a report about a wreck on the main line near Winston, 
Colorado. There was the new budget of the Operating Department, the revised 
budget based on the raise in rates which Jim had obtained last week. She 
tried to choke the exasperation of hopelessness as she went slowly over the 
budget's figures: all those calculations had been made on the assumption that 
the volume of freight would remain unchanged and that the raise would bring 



them added revenue by the end of the year; she knew that the freight tonnage 
would go on shrinking, that the raise would make little difference, that by 
the end of this year their losses would be greater than ever. 

When she looked up from the pages, she saw with a small jolt of 
astonishment that the clock said 9:25. She had been dimly aware of the usual 
sound of movement and voices in the anteroom of her office, as her staff had 
arrived to begin their day; she wondered why nobody had entered her office 
and why her telephone had remained silent; as a daily rule, there should have 
been a rush of business by this hour. She glanced at her calendar; there was 
a note that the McNeil Car Foundry of Chicago was to phone her at nine A.M. 
in regard to the new freight cars which Taggart Transcontinental had been 
expecting for six months. 

She flicked the switch of the interoffice communicator to call her 
secretary. The girl's voice answered with a startled little gasp: "Miss 
Taggart! Are you here, in your office?" 

"I slept here last night, again. Didn't intend to, but did. Was there a 
call for me from the McNeil Car Foundry?" 

"No, Miss Taggart." 

"Put them through to me immediately, when they call," 
"Yes, Miss Taggart." 

Switching the communicator off, she wondered whether she imagined it or 
whether there had been something strange in the girl's voice: it had sounded 
unnaturally tense. 

She felt the faint light-headedness of hunger and thought that she should 
go down to get a cup of coffee, but there was still the report of the chief 
engineer to finish, so she lighted one more cigarette. 

The chief engineer was out on the road, supervising the reconstruction of 
the main track with the Rearden Metal rail taken from the corpse of the John 
Gait Line; she had chosen the sections most urgently in need of repair. 
Opening his report, she read— with a shock of incredulous anger— that he had 
stopped work in the mountain section of Winston, Colorado. He recommended a 
change of plans: he suggested that the rail intended for Winston be used, 
instead, to repair the track of their Washington-to-Miami branch. He gave his 
reasons: a derailment had occurred on that branch last week, and Mr. Tinky 
Holloway of Washington, traveling with a party of friends, had been delayed 
for three hours; it had been reported to the chief engineer that Mr. Holloway 
had expressed extreme displeasure. Although, from a purely technological 
viewpoint— said the chief engineer's report— the rail of the Miami branch was 
in better condition than that of the Winston section, one had to remember, 
from a sociological viewpoint, that the Miami branch carried a much more 
important class of passenger traffic; therefore, the chief engineer suggested 
that Winston could be kept waiting a little longer, and recommended the 
sacrifice of an obscure section of mountain trackage for the sake of a branch 
where "Taggart Transcontinental could not afford to create an unfavorable 
impression . " 

She read, slashing furious pencil marks on the margins of the pages, 
thinking that her first duty of the day, ahead of any other, was to stop this 
particular piece of insanity. 

The telephone rang. 

"Yes?" she asked, snatching the receiver. "McNeil Car Foundry?" 

"No," said the voice of her secretary. "Senor Francisco d'Anconia." 

She looked at the phone's mouthpiece for the instant of a brief shock. 
"All right. Put him on." 

The next voice she heard was Francisco's. "I see that you're in your 
office just the same," he said; his voice was mocking, harsh and tense. 

"Where did you expect me to be?" 

"How do you like the new suspension?" 



"What suspension?" 

"The moratorium on brains." 

"What are you talking about?" 

"Haven't you seen today's newspapers?" 

"No . " 

There was a pause; then his voice came slowly, changed and grave: "Better 
take a look at them, Dagny." 
"All right." 
"I'll call you later." 

She hung up and pressed the switch of the communicator on her desk. "Get 
me a newspaper, " she said to her secretary. 

"Yes, Miss Taggart, " the secretary's voice answered grimly. 

It was Eddie Willers who came in and put the newspaper down on her desk. 
The meaning of the look on his face' was the same as the tone she had caught 
in Francisco's voice: the advance notice of some inconceivable disaster. 

"None of us wanted to be first to tell you, " he said very quietly and 
walked out. 

When she rose from her desk, a few moments later, she felt that she had 
full control of her body and that she was not aware of her body's existence. 
She felt lifted to her feet and it seemed to her that she stood straight, not 
touching the ground. There was an abnormal clarity about every object in the 
room, yet she was seeing nothing around her, but she knew that she would be 
able to see the thread of a cobweb if her purpose required it, just as she 
would be able to walk with a somnambulist's assurance along the edge of a 
roof. She could not know that she was looking at the room with the eyes of a 
person who had lost the capacity and the concept of doubt, and what remained 
to her was the simplicity of a single perception and of a single goal. She 
did not know that the thing which seemed so violent, yet felt like such a 
still, unfamiliar calm within her, was the power of full certainty— and that 
the anger shaking her body, the anger which made her ready, with the same 
passionate indifference, either to kill or to die, was her love of rectitude, 
the only love to which all the years of her life had been given. 

Holding the newspaper in her hand, she walked out of her office and on 
toward the hall. She knew, crossing the anteroom, that the faces of her staff 
were turned to her, but they seemed to be many years away. 

She walked down the hall, moving swiftly but without effort, with the same 
sensation of knowing that her feet were probably touching the ground but that 
she did not feel it. She did not know how many rooms she crossed to reach 
Jim's office, or whether there had been any people in her way, she knew the 
direction to take and the door to pull open to enter unannounced and walk 
toward his desk. 

The newspaper was twisted into a roll by the time she stood before him. 
She threw it at his face, it struck his cheek and fell down to the carpet. 

"There's my resignation, Jim," she said. "I won't work as a slave or as a 
slave-driver . " 

She did not hear the sound of his gasp; it came with the sound of the door 
closing after her. 

She went back to her office and, crossing the anteroom, signaled Eddie to 
follow her inside. 

She said, her voice calm and clear, "I have resigned." 
He nodded silently. 

"I don't know as yet what I'll do in the future. I'm going away, to think 
it over and to decide. If you want to follow me, I'll be at the lodge in 
Woodstock." It was an old hunting cabin in a forest of the Berkshire 
Mountains, which she had inherited from her father and had not visited for 
years . 



"I want to follow," he whispered, "I want to quit, and . . . and I can't. 
I can't make myself do it." 

"Then will you do me a favor?" 
"Of course." 

"Don't communicate with me about the railroad. I don't want to hear it. 
Don't tell anyone where I am, except Hank Rearden. If he asks, tell him about 
the cabin and how to get there. But no one else. I don't want to see 
anybody. " 

"AU right." 

"Promise?" 

"Of course." 

"When I decide what's to become of me, I'll let you know." 

"Ill wait." 

"That's all, Eddie." 

He knew that every word was measured and that nothing else could be said 
between them at this moment. He inclined his head, letting it say the rest, 
then walked out of the office. 

She saw the chief engineer's report still lying open on her desk, and 
thought that she had to order him at once to resume the work on the Winston 
section, then remembered that it was not her problem any longer. She felt no 
pain. She knew that the pain would come later and that it would be a tearing 
agony of pain, and that the numbness of this moment was a rest granted to 
her, not after, but before, to make her ready to bear it. But it did not 
matter. If that is required of me, then I'll bear it— she thought. 

She sat down at her desk and telephoned Rearden at his mills in 
Pennsylvania . 

"Hello, dearest," he said. He said it simply and clearly, as if he wanted 
to say it because it was real and right, and he needed to hold on to the 
concepts of reality and Tightness. 

"Hank, I've quit." 

"I see." He sounded as if he had expected it. 

"Nobody came to get me, no destroyer, perhaps there never was any 
destroyer, after all. I don't know what I'll do next, but I have to get away, 
so that I won't have to see any of them for a while. Then I'll decide. I know 
that you can't go with me right now." 

"No. I have two weeks in which they expect me to sign their Gift 
Certificate. I want to be right here when the two weeks expire." 

"Do you need me— for the two weeks?" 

"No. It's worse for you than for me. You have no way to fight them. I 
have. I think I'm glad they did it. It's clear and final. Don't worry about 
me. Rest. Rest from all of it, first." 

"Yes . " 

"Where are you going?" 

"To the country. To a cabin I own in the Berkshires. If you want to see 
me, Eddie Willers will tell you the way to get there. I'll be back in two 
weeks . " 

"Will you do me a favor?" 

"Yes . " 

"Don't come back until I come for you." 
"But I want to be here, when it happens." 
"Leave that up to me." 

"Whatever they do to you, I want it done to me also." 

"Leave it up to me. Dearest, don't you understand? I think that what I 
want most right now is what you want: not to see any of them. But I have to 
stay here for a while. So it will help me if I know that you, at least, are 
out of their reach. I want to keep one clean point in my mind, to lean 



against. It will be only a short while— and then I'll come for you. Do you 
understand? " 

"Yes, my darling. So long." 

It was weightlessly easy to walk out of her office and down the stretching 
halls of Taggart Transcontinental. She walked, looking ahead, her steps 
advancing with the unbroken, unhurried rhythm of finality. 

Her face was held level and it had a look of astonishment, of acceptance, 
of repose. 

She walked across the concourse of the Terminal. She saw the statue of 
Nathaniel Taggart. But she felt no pain from it and no reproach, only the 
rising fullness of her love, only the feeling that she was going to join him, 
not in death, but in that which had been his life. 

The first man to quit at Rearden Steel was Tom Colby, rolling mill 
foreman, head of the Rearden Steel Workers Union. For ten years, he had heard 
himself denounced throughout the country, because his was a "company union" 
and because he had never engaged in a violent conflict with the management. 
This was true: no conflict had ever been necessary; Rearden paid a higher 
wage scale than any union scale in the country, for which he demanded— and 
got— the best labor force to be found anywhere. 

When Tom Colby told him that he was quitting, Rearden nodded, without 
comment or questions. 

"I won't work under these conditions, myself," Colby added quietly, "and I 
won't help, to keep the men working. They trust me. I won't be the Judas goat 
leading them to the stockyards." 

"What are you going to do for a living?" asked Rearden. 

"I've saved enough to last me for about a year." 

"And after that?" 

Colby shrugged. 

Rearden thought of the boy with the angry eyes, who mined coal at night as 
a criminal. He thought of all the dark roads, the alleys, the back yards of 
the country, where the best of the country's men would now exchange their 
services in jungle barter, in chance jobs, in unrecorded transactions. He 
thought of the end of that road. 

Tom Colby seemed to know what he was thinking. "You're on your way to end 
up right alongside of me, Mr. Rearden," he said. "Are you going to sign your 
brains over to them?" 

"No . " 

"And after that?" 
Rearden shrugged. 

Colby's eyes watched him for a moment, pale, shrewd eyes in a furnace- 
tanned face with soot-engraved wrinkles. "They've been telling us for years 
that it's you against me, Mr. Rearden. But it isn't. It's Orren Boyle and 
Fred Kinnan against you and me." 

"I know it." 

The Wet Nurse had never entered Rearden ' s office, as if sensing that that 
was a place he had no right to enter. He always waited to catch a glimpse of 
Rearden outside. The directive had attached him to his job, as the mills' 
official watchdog of over-or-under-production . He stopped Rearden, a few days 
later, in an alley between the rows of open-hearth furnaces. There was an odd 
look of fierceness on the boy's face. 

"Mr. Rearden," he said, "I wanted to tell you that if you want to pour ten 
times the quota of Rearden Metal or steel or pig iron or anything, and 
bootleg it all over the place to anybody at any price— I wanted to tell you to 
go ahead. Ill fix it up. I'll juggle the books, I'll fake the reports, I'll 
get phony witnesses, I'll forge affidavits, I'll commit perjury— so you don't 
have to worry, there won't be any trouble!" 



"Now why do you want to do that?" asked Rearden, smiling, but his smile 
vanished when he heard the boy answer earnestly: "Because I want, for once, 
to do something moral." 

"That's not the way to be moral—" Rearden started, and stopped abruptly, 
realizing that- it was the way, the only way left, realizing through how many 
twists of intellectual corruption upon corruption this boy had to struggle 
toward his momentous discovery. 

"I guess that's not the word," the boy said sheepishly. "I know it's a 
stuffy, old-fashioned word. That's not what I meant. I meant—" It was a 
sudden, desperate cry of incredulous anger: "Mr. Rearden, they have no right 
to do it!" 

"What?" 

"Take Rearden Metal away from you." 

Rearden smiled and, prompted by a desperate pity, said, "Forget it, Non- 
Absolute. There are no rights." 

"I know there aren't. But I mean . . . what I mean is that they can't do 
it. " 

"Why not?" He could not help smiling. 

"Mr. Rearden, don't sign the Gift Certificate! Don't sign it, on 
principle . " 

"I won't sign it. But there aren't any principles." 

"I know there aren't." He was reciting it in full earnestness, with the 
honesty of a conscientious student: "I know that everything is relative and 
that nobody can know anything and that reason is an illusion and that there 
isn't any reality. But I'm just talking about Rearden Metal. 

Don't sign, Mr. Rearden. Morals or no morals, principles or no principles, 
just don't sign it— because it isn't right!" 

No one else mentioned the directive in Rearden 's presence. Silence was the 
new aspect about the mills. The men did not speak to him when he appeared in 
the workshops, and he noticed that they did not speak to one another. The 
personnel office received no formal resignations. But every other morning, 
one or two men failed to appear and never appeared again. Inquiries at their 
homes found the homes abandoned and the men gone. The personnel office did 
not report these desertions, as the directive required; instead, Rearden 
began to see unfamiliar faces among the workers, the drawn, beaten faces of 
the long unemployed, and heard them addressed by the names of the men who had 
quit. He asked no questions. 

There was silence throughout the country. He did not know how many 
industrialists had retired and vanished on May I and 2, leaving their plants 
to be seized. He counted ten among his own customers, including McNeil of the 
McNeil Car Foundry in Chicago. He had no way of learning about the others; no 
reports appeared in the newspapers. 

The front pages of the newspapers were suddenly full of stories about 
spring floods, traffic accidents, school picnics and golden-wedding 
anniversaries . 

There was silence in his own home. Lillian had departed on a vacation trip 
to Florida, in mid-April; it had astonished him, as an inexplicable whim; it 
was the first trip she had taken alone since their marriage. Philip avoided 
him, with a look of panic. His mother stared at Rearden in reproachful 
bewilderment; she said nothing, but she kept bursting into tears in his 
presence, her manner suggesting that her tears were the most important aspect 
to consider in whatever disaster it was that she sensed approaching. 

On the morning of May 15, he sat at the desk in his office, above the 
spread of the mills, and watched the colors of the smoke rising to the clear, 
blue sky. There were spurts of transparent smoke, like waves of heat, 
invisible but for the structures that shivered behind them; there were 
streaks of red smoke, and sluggish columns of yellow, and light, floating 



spirals of blue— and the thick, tight, swiftly pouring coils that looked like 
twisted bolts of satin tinged a mother-of-pearl pink by the summer sun. 

The buzzer rang on his desk, and Miss Ives voice said, "Dr. Floyd Ferris 
to see you, without appointment, Mr. Rearden." In spite of its rigid 
formality, her tone conveyed the question: Shall I throw him out? 

There was a faint movement of astonishment in Rearden 's face, barely above 
the line of indifference: he had not expected that particular emissary. He 
answered evenly, "Ask him to come in." 

Dr. Ferris did not smile as he walked toward Rearden ' s desk; he merely 
wore a look suggesting that Rearden knew full well that he had good reason to 
smile and so he would abstain from the obvious. 

He sat down in front of the desk, not waiting for an invitation; he 
carried a briefcase, which he placed across his knees; he acted as if words 
were superfluous, since his reappearance in this office had made everything 
clear . 

Rearden sat watching him in patient silence. 

"Since the deadline for the signing of the national Gift Certificates 
expires tonight at midnight," said Dr. Ferris, in the tone of a salesman 
extending a special courtesy to a customer, "I have come to obtain your 
signature, Mr. Rearden." 

He paused, with an air of suggesting that the formula now called for an 
answer . 

"Go on," said Rearden. "I am listening." 

"Yes, I suppose I should explain," said Dr. Ferris, "that we wish to get 
your signature early in the day in order to announce the fact on a national 
news broadcast. Although the gift program has gone through quite smoothly, 
there are still a few stubborn individualists left, who have failed to sign- 
small fry, really, whose patents are of no crucial value, but we cannot let 
them remain unbound, as a matter of principle, you understand. They are, we 
believe, waiting to follow your lead. You have a great popular following, Mr. 
Rearden, much greater than you suspected or knew how to use. Therefore, the 
announcement that you have signed will remove the last hopes of resistance 
and, by midnight, will bring in the last signatures, thus completing the 
program on schedule." 

Rearden knew that of all possible speeches, this was the last Dr. 

Ferris would make if any doubt of his surrender remained in the man's 
mind . 

"Go on," said Rearden evenly. "You haven't finished." 

"You know— as you have demonstrated at your trial— how important it is, and 
why, that we obtain all that property with the voluntary consent of the 
victims." Dr. Ferris opened his briefcase. "Here is the Gift Certificate, Mr. 
Rearden. We have filled it out and all you have to do is to sign your name at 
the bottom. " 

The piece of paper, which he placed in front of Rearden, looked like a 
small college diploma, with the text printed in old-fashioned script and the 
particulars inserted by typewriter. The thing stated that he, Henry Rearden, 
hereby transferred to the nation all rights to the metal alloy now known as 
"Rearden Metal," which would henceforth be manufactured by all who so 
desired, and which would bear the name of "Miracle Metal," chosen by the 
representatives of the people. 

Glancing at the paper, Rearden wondered whether it was a deliberate 
mockery of decency, or so low an estimate of their victims' intelligence, 
that had made the designers of this paper print the text across a faint 
drawing of the Statue of Liberty. 

His eyes moved slowly to Dr. Ferris' face. "You would not have come here," 
he said, "unless you had some extraordinary kind of blackjack to use on me. 
What is it?" 



"Of course," said Dr. Ferris. "I would expect you to understand that. That 
is why no lengthy explanations are necessary." He opened his briefcase. "Do 
you wish to see my blackjack? I have brought a few samples." 

In the manner of a cardsharp whisking out a long fan of cards with one 
snap of the hand, he spread before Rearden a line of glossy photographic 
prints. They were photostats of hotel and auto court registers, bearing in 
Rearden 's handwriting the names of Mr. and Mrs. J. 

Smith. 

"You know, of course," said Dr. Ferris softly, "but you might wish to see 
whether we know it, that Mrs. J. Smith is Miss Dagny Taggart." 

He found nothing to observe in Rearden 's face. Rearden had not moved to 
bend over the prints, but sat looking down at them with grave attentiveness , 
as if, from the perspective of distance, he were discovering something about 
them which he had not known. 

"We have a great deal of additional evidence," said Dr. Ferris, and tossed 
down on the desk a photostat of the jeweler's bill for the ruby pendant. "You 
wouldn't care to see the sworn statements of apartment house doormen and 
night clerks— they contain nothing that would be new to you, except the number 
of witnesses who know where you spent your nights in New York, for about the 
last two years. You mustn't blame those people too much. It's an interesting 
characteristic of epochs such as ours that people begin to be afraid of 
saying the things they want to say— and afraid, when questioned, to remain 
silent about things they'd prefer never to utter. That is to be expected. But 
you would be astonished if you knew who gave us the original tip." 

"I know it," said Rearden; his voice conveyed no reaction. The trip to 
Florida was not inexplicable to him any longer. 

"There is nothing in this blackjack of mine that can harm you personally," 
said Dr. Ferris, "We knew that no form of personal injury would ever make you 
give in. Therefore, I am telling you frankly that this will not hurt you at 
all. It will only hurt Miss Taggart" 

Rearden was looking straight at him now, but Dr. Ferris wondered why it 
seemed to him that the calm, closed face was moving away into a greater and 
greater distance. 

"If this affair of yours is spread from one end of the country to the 
other," said Dr, Ferris, "by such experts in the art of smearing as Bertram 
Scudder, it will do no actual damage to your reputation. 

Beyond a few glances of curiosity and a few raised eyebrows in a few of 
the stuffier drawing rooms, you will get off quite easily. Affairs of this 
sort are expected of a man. In fact, it will enhance your reputation. 

It will give you an aura of romantic glamour among the women and, among 
the men, it will give you a certain kind of prestige, in the nature of envy 
for an unusual conquest. But what it will do to Miss Taggart— with her 
spotless name, her reputation for being above scandal, her peculiar position 
of a woman in a strictly masculine business— 

what it will do to her, what she will see in the eyes of everyone she 
meets, what she will hear from every man she deals with— I will leave that up 
to your own mind to imagine. And to consider." 

Rearden felt nothing but a great stillness and a great clarity. It was as 
if some voice were telling him sternly: This is the time— the scene is 
lighted— now look. And standing naked in the great light, he was looking 
quietly, solemnly, stripped of fear, of pain, of hope, with nothing left to 
him but the desire to know. 

Dr. Ferris was astonished to hear him say slowly, in the dispassionate 
tone of an abstract statement that did not seem to be addressed to his 
listener, "But all your calculations rest on the fact that Miss Taggart is a 
virtuous woman, not the slut you're going to call her." 

"Yes, of course," said Dr. Ferris. 



"And that this means much more to me than a casual affair." 
"Of course . " 

"If she and I were the kind of scum you're going to make us appear, your 
blackjack wouldn't work." 
"No, it wouldn't." 

"If our relationship were the depravity you're going to proclaim it to be, 
you'd have no way to harm us." 
"No . " 

"We'd be outside your power." 
"Actually-yes . " 

It was not to Dr. Ferris that Rearden was speaking. He was seeing a long 
line of men stretched through the centuries from Plato onward, whose heir and 
final product was an incompetent little professor with the appearance of a 
gigolo and the soul of a thug. 

"I offered you, once, a chance to join us," said Dr. Ferris. "You refused. 
Now you can see the consequences. How a man of your intelligence thought that 
he could win by playing it straight, I can't imagine." 

"But if I had joined you," said Rearden with the same detachment, as if he 
were not speaking about himself, "what would I have found worth looting from 
Orren Boyle?" 

"Oh hell, there's always enough suckers to expropriate in the world!" 

"Such as Miss Taggart? As Ken Danagger? As Ellis Wyatt? As I?" 

"Such as any man who wants to be impractical." 

"You mean that it is not practical to live on earth, is it?" 

He did not know whether Dr. Ferris answered him. He was not listening any 
longer. He was seeing the pendulous face of Orren Boyle with the small slits 
of pig's eyes, the doughy face of Mr. Mowen with the eyes that scurried away 
from any speaker and any fact— he was seeing them go through the jerky motions 
of an ape performing a routine it had learned to copy by muscular habit, 
performing it in order to manufacture Rearden Metal, with no knowledge and no 
capacity to know what had taken place in the experimental laboratory of 
Rearden Steel through ten years of passionate devotion to an excruciating 
effort. It was proper that they should now call it "Miracle Metal".— a miracle 
was the only name they could give to those ten years and to that faculty from 
which Rearden Metal was born— a miracle was all that the Metal could be in 
their eyes, the product of an unknown, unknowable cause, an object in nature, 
not to be explained, but to be seized, like a stone or a weed, theirs for the 
seizing— "are we to let the many remain in want while the few withhold from us 
the better products and methods available?" 

If I had not known that my life depends on my mind and my effort— he was 
saying soundlessly to the line of men stretched through the centuries— if I 
had not made it my highest moral purpose to exercise the best of my effort 
and the fullest capacity of my mind in order to support and expand my life, 
you would have found nothing to loot from me, nothing to support your own 
existence. It is not my sins that you're using to injure me, but my virtues— 
my virtues by your own acknowledgment, since your own life depends on them, 
since you need them, since you do not seek to destroy my achievement but to 
seize it. 

He remembered the voice of the gigolo of science saying to him: "We're 
after power and we mean it. You fellows were pikers, but we know the real 
trick." We were not after power— he said to the gigolo's ancestors-in-spirit— 
and we did not live by means of that which we condemned. We regarded 
productive ability as virtue— and we let the degree of his virtue be the 
measure of a man's reward. We drew no advantage from the things we regarded 
as evil— we did not require the existence of bank robbers in order to operate 
our banks, or of burglars in order to provide for our homes, or of murderers 
in order to protect our lives. But you need the products of a man's ability— 



yet you proclaim that productive ability is a selfish evil and you turn the 
degree of a man's productiveness into the measure of his loss. We lived by 
that which we held to be good and punished that which we held to be evil. You 
live by that which you denounce as evil and punish that which you know to be 
good . 

He remembered the formula of the punishment that Lillian had sought to 
impose on him, the formula he had considered too monstrous to believe— and he 
saw it now in its full application, as a system of thought, as a way of life 
and on a world scale. There it was: the punishment that required the victim's 
own virtue as the fuel to make it work— his invention of Rearden Metal being 
used as the cause of his expropriation— Dagny ' s honor and the depth of their 
feeling for each other being used as a tool of blackmail, a blackmail from 
which the depraved would be immune— and, in the People's States of Europe, 
millions of men being held in bondage by means of their desire to live, by 
means of their energy drained in forced labor, by means of their ability to 
feed their masters, by means of the hostage system, of their love for their 
children or wives or friends— by means of love, ability and pleasure as the 
fodder for threats and the bait for extortion, with love tied to fear, 
ability to punishment, ambition to confiscation, with blackmail as law, with 
escape from pain, not quest for pleasure, as the only incentive to effort and 
the only reward of achievement— men held enslaved by means of whatever living 
power they possessed and of whatever joy they found in life. Such was the 
code that the world had accepted and such was the key to the code: that it 
hooked man's love of existence to a circuit of torture, so that only the man 
who had nothing to offer would have nothing to fear, so that the virtues 
which made life possible and the values which gave it meaning became the 
agents of its destruction, so that one's best became the tool of one's agony, 
and man's life on earth became impractical. 

"Yours was the code of life, " said the voice of a man whom he could not 
forget. "What, then, is theirs?" 

Why had the world accepted it?— he thought. How had the victims come to 
sanction a code that pronounced them guilty of the fact of existing? . . . 
And then the violence of an inner blow became the total stillness of his body 
as he sat looking at a sudden vision: Hadn't he done it also? Hadn't he given 
his sanction to the code of self damnation? Dagny— he thought— and the depth of 
their feeling for each other . . . the blackmail from which the depraved 
would be immune . . . hadn't he, too, once called it depravity? Hadn't he 
been first to throw at her all the insults which the human scum was now 
threatening to throw at her in public? Hadn't he accepted as guilt the 
highest happiness he had ever found? 

"You who won't allow one per cent of impurity into an alloy of metal," the 
unforgotten voice was saying to him, "what have you allowed into your moral 
code?" 

"Well, Mr. Rearden?" said the voice of Dr, Ferris. "Do you understand me 
now? Do we get the Metal or do we make a public showplace out of Miss 
Taggart ' s bedroom? " 

He was not seeing Dr. Ferris. He was seeing— in the violent clarity that 
was like a spotlight tearing every riddle open to him— the day he met Dagny 
for the first time. 

It was a few months after she had become Vice-President of Taggart 
Transcontinental. He had been hearing skeptically, for some time, the rumors 
that the railroad was run by Jim Taggart ' s sister. That summer, when he grew 
exasperated at Taggart ' s delays and contradictions over an order of rail for 
a new cutoff, an order which Taggart kept placing, altering and withdrawing, 
somebody told him that if he wished to get any sense or action out of Taggart 
Transcontinental, he'd better speak to Jim's sister. He telephoned her office 
to make an appointment and insisted on having it that same afternoon. Her 



secretary told him that Miss Taggart would be at the construction site of the 
new cutoff, that afternoon, at Milford Station between New York and 
Philadelphia, but would be glad to see him there if he wished. He went to the 
appointment resentfully; he did not like such businesswomen as he had met, 
and he felt that railroads were no business for a woman to play with; he 
expected a spoiled heiress who used her name and sex as substitute for 
ability, some eyebrow-plucked, over groomed female, like the lady executives 
of department stores. 

He got off the last car of a long train, far beyond the platform of 
Milford Station. There was a clutter of sidings, freight cars, cranes and 
steam shovels around him, descending from the main track down the slope of a 
ravine where men were grading the roadbed of the new cutoff. He started 
walking between the sidings toward the station building. Then he stopped. 

He saw a girl standing on top of a pile of machinery on a flatcar. 

She was looking off at the ravine, her head lifted, strands of disordered 
hair stirring in the wind. Her plain gray suit was like a thin coating of 
metal over a slender body against the spread of sun-flooded space and sky. 
Her posture had the lightness and unself-conscious precision of an arrogantly 
pure self-confidence. She was watching the work, her glance intent and 
purposeful, the glance of competence enjoying its own function. She looked as 
if this were her place, her moment and her world, she looked as if enjoyment 
were her natural state, her face was the living form of an active, living 
intelligence., a young girl's face with a woman's mouth, she seemed unaware 
of her body except as of a taut instrument ready to serve her purpose in any 
manner she wished. 

Had he asked himself a moment earlier whether he carried in his mind an 
image of what he wanted a woman to look like, he would have answered that he 
did not; yet, seeing her, he knew that this was the image and that it had 
been for years. But he was not looking at her as at a woman. He had forgotten 
where he was and on what errand, he was held by a child's sensation of joy in 
the immediate moment, by the delight of the unexpected and undiscovered, he 
was held by the astonishment of realizing how seldom he came upon a sight he 
truly liked, liked in complete acceptance and for its own sake, he was 
looking up at her with a faint smile, as he would have looked at a statue or 
a landscape, and what he felt was the sheer pleasure of the sight, the purest 
esthetic pleasure he had ever experienced. 

He saw a switchman going by and he asked, pointing, "Who is that?" 

"Dagny Taggart," said the man, walking on. 

Rearden felt as if the words struck him inside his throat. He felt the 
start of a current that cut his breath for a moment, then went slowly down 
his body, carrying in its wake a sense of weight, a drained heaviness that 
left him no capacity but one. He was aware— with an abnormal clarity— of the 
place, the woman's name, and everything it implied, but all of it had receded 
into some outer ring and had become a pressure that left him alone in the 
center, as the ring's meaning and essence— and his only reality was the desire 
to have this woman, now, here, on top of the flatcar in the open sun— to have 
her before a word was spoken between them, as the first act of their meeting, 
because it would say everything and because they had earned it long ago. 

She turned her head. In the slow curve of the movement, her eyes came to 
his and stopped. He felt certain that she saw the nature of his glance, that 
she was held by it, yet did not name it to herself. 

Her eyes moved on and he saw her speak to some man who stood beside the 
flatcar, taking notes. 

Two things struck him together: his return to his normal reality, and the 
shattering impact of guilt. He felt a moment's approach to that which no man 
may feel fully and survive: a sense of self -hatred— the more terrible because 
some part of him refused to accept it and made him feel guiltier. It was not 



a progression of words, but the instantaneous verdict of an emotion, a 
verdict that told him: This, then, was his nature, this was his depravity— 
that the shameful desire he had never been able to conquer, came to him in 
response to the only sight of beauty he had found, that it came with a 
violence he had not known to be possible, and that the only freedom now left 
to him was to hide it and to despise himself, but never to be rid of it so 
long as he and this woman were alive. 

He did not know how long he stood there or what devastation that span of 
time left within him. All that he could preserve was the will to decide that 
she must never know it. 

He waited until she had descended to the ground and the man with the notes 
had departed; then he approached her and said coldly: "Miss Taggart? I am 
Henry Rearden." 

"Oh!" It was just a small break, then he heard the quietly natural "How do 
you do, Mr. Rearden." 

He knew, not admitting it to himself, that the break came from some faint 
equivalent of his own feeling: she was glad that a face she had liked 
belonged to a man she could admire. When he proceeded to speak to her about 
business, his manner was more harshly abrupt than it had ever been with any 
of his masculine customers. 

Now, looking from the memory of the girl on the flatcar to the Gift 
Certificate lying on his desk, he felt as if the two met in a single shock, 
fusing all the days and doubts he had lived between them, and, by the glare 
of the explosion, in a moment's vision of a final sum, he saw the answer to 
all his questions. 

He thought: Guilty?— guiltier than I had known, far guiltier than I had 
thought, that day— guilty of the evil of damning as guilt that which was my 
best. I damned the fact that my mind and body were a unit, and that my body 
responded to the values of my mind. I damned the fact that joy is the core of 
existence, the motive power of every living being, that it is the need of 
one's body as it is the goal of one's spirit, that my body was not a weight 
of inanimate muscles, but an instrument able to give me an experience of 
superlative joy to unite my flesh and my spirit. That capacity, which I 
damned as shameful, had left me indifferent to sluts, but gave me my one 
desire in answer to a woman's greatness. That desire, which I damned as 
obscene, did not come from the sight of her body, but from the knowledge that 
the lovely form I saw, did express the spirit I was seeing— 

it was not her body that I wanted, but her person— it was not the girl in 
gray that I had to possess, but the woman who ran a railroad. 

But I damned my body's capacity to express what I felt, I damned, as an 
affront to her, the highest tribute I could give her— just as they damn my 
ability to translate the work of my mind into Rearden Metal, just as they 
damn me for the power to transform matter to serve my needs. I accepted their 
code and believed, as they taught me, that the values of one's spirit must 
remain as an impotent longing, unexpressed in action, untranslated into 
reality, while the life of one's body must be lived in misery, as a 
senseless, degrading performance, and those who attempt to enjoy it must be 
branded as inferior animals. 

I broke their code, but I fell into the trap they intended, the trap of a 
code devised to be broken. I took no pride in my rebellion, I took it as 
guilt, I did not damn them, I damned myself, I did not damn their code, I 
damned existence— and I hid my happiness as a shameful secret. I should have 
lived it openly, as of our right— or made her my wife, as in truth she was. 
But I branded my happiness as evil and made her bear it as a disgrace. What 
they want to do to her now, I did it first. I made it possible. 

I did it— in the name of pity for the most contemptible woman I know. That, 
too, was their code, and I accepted it. I believed that one person owes a 



duty to another with no payment for it in return. I believed that it was my 
duty to love a woman who gave me nothing, who betrayed everything I lived 
for, who demanded her happiness at the price of mine. I believed that love is 
some static gift which, once granted, need no longer be deserved— j ust as they 
believe that wealth is a static possession which can be seized and held 
without further effort. I believed that love is a gratuity, not a reward to 
be earned— 

just as they believe it is their right to demand an unearned wealth. 

And just as they believe that their need is a claim on my energy, so I 
believed that her unhappiness was a claim on my life. For the sake of pity, 
not justice, T endured ten years of self-torture. I placed pity above my own 
conscience, and this is the core of my guilt. My crime was committed when I 
said to her, "By every standard of mine, to maintain our marriage will be a 
vicious fraud. But my standards are not yours. 

I do not understand yours, I never have, but I will accept them." 

Here they are, lying on my desk, those standards I accepted without 
understanding, here is the manner of her love for me, that love which I never 
believed, but tried to spare. Here is the final product of the unearned. I 
thought that it was proper to commit injustice, so long as I would be the 
only one to suffer. But nothing can justify injustice. 

And this is the punishment for accepting as proper that hideous evil which 
is self-immolation. I thought that I would be the only victim. 

Instead, I've sacrificed the noblest woman to the vilest. When one acts on 
pity against justice, it is the good whom one punishes for the sake of the 
evil; when one saves the guilty from suffering, it is the innocent whom one 
forces to suffer. There is no escape from justice, nothing can be unearned 
and unpaid for in the universe, neither in matter nor in spirit— and if the 
guilty do not pay, then the innocent have to pay it. 

It was not the cheap little looters of wealth who have beaten me— 

it was I. They did not disarm me— I threw away my weapon. This is a battle 
that cannot be fought except with clean hands— because the enemy's sole power 
is in the sores of one's conscience— and I accepted a code that made me regard 
the strength of my hands as a sin and a stain. 

"Do we get the Metal, Mr. Rearden?" 

He looked from the Gift Certificate on his desk to the memory of the girl 
on the flatcar. He asked himself whether he could deliver the radiant being 
he had seen in that moment, to the looters of the mind and the thugs of the 
press. Could he continue to let the innocent bear punishment? Could he let 
her take the stand he should have taken? 

Could he now defy the enemy's code, when the disgrace would be hers, not 
his— when the muck would be thrown at her, not at him— 

when she would have to fight, while he'd be spared? Could he let her 
existence be turned into a hell he would have no way of sharing? 

He sat still, looking up at her, I love you, he said to the girl on the 
flatcar, silently pronouncing the words that had been the meaning of that 
moment four years ago, feeling the solemn happiness that belonged with the 
words, even though this was how he had to say it to her for the first time. 

He looked down at the. Gift Certificate. Dagny, he thought, you would not 
let me do it if you knew, you will hate me for it if you learn— but I cannot 
let you pay my debts. The fault was mine and I will not shift to you the 
punishment which is mine to take. Even if I have nothing else now left to me, 
I have this much: that I see the truth, that I am free of their guilt, that I 
can now stand guiltless in my own eyes, that I know I am right, right fully 
and for the first time— and that I will remain faithful to the one commandment 
of my code which I have never broken: to be a man who pays his own way. 

I love you, he said to the girl on the flatcar, feeling as if the light of 
that summer's sun were touching his forehead, as if he, too, were standing 



under an open sky over an unobstructed earth, with nothing left to him except 
himself . 

"Well, Mr. Rearden? Are you going to sign?'l asked Dr. Ferris. 
Rearden's eyes moved to him. He had forgotten that Ferris was there, he 
did not know whether Ferris had been speaking, arguing or waiting in silence. 
"Oh, that?" said Rearden. 

He picked up a pen and with no second glance, with the easy gesture of a 
millionaire signing a check, he signed his name at the foot of the Statue of 
Liberty and pushed the Gift Certificate across the desk. 



CHAPTER VII 
THE MORATORIUM ON BRAINS 



"Where have you been all this time?" Eddie Willers asked the worker in the 
underground cafeteria, and added, with a smile that was an appeal, an apology 
and a confession of despair, "Oh, I know it's I who've stayed away from here 
for weeks." The smile looked like the effort of a crippled child groping for 
a gesture that he could not perform any longer. "I did come here once, about 
two weeks ago, but you weren't here that night. I was afraid you'd gone . . . 
so many people are vanishing without notice. I hear there's hundreds of them 
roving around the country. The police have been arresting them for leaving 
their jobs— they're called deserters— but there's too many of them and no food 
to feed them in jail, so nobody gives a damn any more, one way or another. I 
hear the deserters are just wandering about, doing odd jobs or worse— who's 
got any odd jobs to offer these days? . . . It's our best men that we're 
losing, the kind who've been with the company for twenty years or more. Why 
did they have to chain them to their jobs? Those men never intended to quit- 
but now they're quitting at the slightest disagreement, just dropping their 
tools and walking off, any hour of the day or night, leaving us in all sorts 
of jams— the men who used to leap out of bed and come running if the railroad 
needed them. . . . You should see the kind of human driftwood we're getting 
to fill the vacancies. Some of them mean well, but they're scared of their 
own shadows. Others are the kind of scum I didn't think existed— they get the 
jobs and they know that we can't throw them out once they're in, so they make 
it clear that they don't intend to work for their pay and never did intend. 
They're the kind of men who like it— who like the way things are now. Can you 
imagine that there are human beings who like it? Well, there are. . . . You 
know, I don't think that I really believe it— all that's happening to us these 
days. It's happening all right, but I don't believe it. I keep thinking that 
insanity is a state where a person can't tell what's real. 

Well, what's real now is insane— and if I accepted it as real, I'd have to 
lose my mind, wouldn't I? . . . I go on working and I keep telling myself 
that this is Taggart Transcontinental. I keep waiting for her to come back— 
for die door to open at any moment and— oh God, I'm not supposed to say that! 
. . . What? You knew it? You knew that she's gone? . . . They're keeping it 
secret. But I guess everybody knows it, only nobody is supposed to say it. 
They're telling people that she's away on a leave of absence. She's still 
listed as our Vice-President in Charge of Operation. I think Jim and I are 
the only ones who know that she has resigned for good. Jim is scared to death 
that his friends in Washington will take it out on him, if it becomes known 
that she's quit. It's supposed to be disastrous for public morale, if any 
prominent person quits, and Jim doesn't want them to know that he's got a 
deserter right in his own family. . . . But that's not all. Jim is scared 
that the stockholders, the employees and whoever we do business with, will 
lose the last of their confidence in Taggart Transcontinental if they learn 
that she's gone. Confidence! You'd think that it wouldn't matter now, since 
there's nothing any of them can do about it. And yet, Jim knows that we have 
to preserve some semblance of the greatness that Taggart Transcontinental 
once stood for. And he knows that the last of it went with her. . . . No, 
they don't know where she is. . . . Yes, I do, but I won't tell them. I'm the 
only one who knows. . . . Oh yes, they've been trying to find out. They've 
tried to pump me in every way they could think of, but it's no use. 

I won't tell anyone. . . . You should see the trained seal that we now 
have in her place— our new Operating Vice-President. Oh sure, we have one— that 
is, we have and we haven't. It's like everything they do today— it is and it 
ain't, at the same tune. His name is Clifton Locey— 



he's from Jim's personal staff— a bright, progressive young man of 
fortyseven and a friend of Jim's. He's only supposed to be pinch-hitting for 
her, but he sits in her office and we all know that that's the new Operating 
Vice-President. He gives the orders— that is, he sees to it that he's never 
caught actually giving an order. He works very hard at making sure that no 
decision can ever be pinned down on him, so that he won't be blamed for 
anything. You see, his purpose is not to operate a railroad, but to hold a 
job. He doesn't want to run trains- 
he wants to please Jim. He doesn't give a damn whether there's a single 
train moving or not, so long as he can make a good impression on Jim and on 
the boys in Washington. So far, Mr. Clifton Locey has managed to frame up two 
men: a young third assistant, for not relaying an order which Mr. Locey had 
never given— and the freight manager, for issuing an order which Mr. Locey did 
give, only the freight manager couldn't prove it. Both men were fired, 
officially, by ruling of the Unification Board. . . . When things go well— 
which is never longer than half an hour— Mr. Locey makes it a point to remind 
us that 'these are not the days of Miss Taggart. ' At the first sign of 
trouble, he calls me into his office and asks me— casually, in the midst of 
the most irrelevant drivel— what Miss Taggart used to do in such an emergency. 
I tell him, whenever I can. I tell myself that it's Taggart Transcontinental, 
and . . . and there's thousands of lives on dozens of trains that hang on our 
decisions. Between emergencies, Mr. Locey goes out of his way to be rude to 
me— that ' s so I wouldn't think that he needs me. He's made it a point to 
change everything she used to do, in every respect that doesn't matter, but 
he's damn cautious not to change anything that matters. The only trouble is 
that he can't always tell which is which. . . . On his first day in her 
office, he told me that it wasn't a good idea to have a picture of Nat 
Taggart on the wall— 

'Nat Taggart, ' he said, 'belongs to a dark past, to the age of selfish 
greed, he is not exactly a symbol of our modern, progressive policies, so it 
could make a bad impression, people could identify me with him.' 'No, they 
couldn't, ' I said— but I took the picture off his wall. . . . What? 

. . . No, she doesn't know any of it. I haven't communicated with her. 
Not once. She told me not to. . . . Last week, I almost quit. It was over 
Chick's Special. Mr. Chick Morrison of Washington, whoever the hell he is, 
has gone on a speaking tour of the whole country— to speak about the directive 
and build up the people's morale, as things are getting to be pretty wild 
everywhere. He demanded a special train, for himself and party— a sleeper, a 
parlor car and a diner with barroom and lounge. The Unification Board gave 
him permission to travel at a hundred miles an hour— by reason, the ruling 
said, of this being a non-profit journey. Well, so it is. It's just a journey 
to talk people into continuing to break their backs at making profits in 
order to support men who are superior by reason of not making any. Well, our 
trouble came when Mr. Chick Morrison demanded a Diesel engine for his train. 
We had none to give him. Every Diesel we own is out on the road, pulling the 
Comet and the transcontinental freights, and there wasn't a spare one 
anywhere on the system, except— well, that was an exception I wasn't going to 
mention to Mr. Clifton Locey. 

Mr. Locey raised the roof, screaming that come hell or high water we 
couldn't refuse a demand of Mr. Chick Morrison. I don't know what damn fool 
finally told him about the extra Diesel that was kept at Winston, Colorado, 
at the mouth of the tunnel. You know the way our Diesels break down nowadays, 
they're all breathing their last— so you can understand why that extra Diesel 
had to be kept at the tunnel. I explained it to Mr. Locey, I threatened him, 
I pleaded, I told him that she had made it our strictest rule that Winston 
Station was never to be left without an extra Diesel. He told me to remember 
that he was not Miss Taggart— as if I could ever forget it!— and that the rule 



was nonsense, because nothing had happened all these years, so Winston could 
do without a Diesel for a couple of months, and he wasn't going to worry 
about some theoretical disaster in the future when we were up against the 
very real, practical, immediate disaster of getting Mr. 

Chick Morrison angry at us. Well, Chick's Special got the Diesel. The 
superintendent of the Colorado Division quit. Mr. Locey gave that job to a 
friend of his own. I wanted to quit. I had never wanted to so badly. But I 
didn't. . . . No, I haven't heard from her. I haven't heard a word since she 
left. Why do you keep questioning me about her? Forget it. She won't be back, 
. . . I don't know what it is that I'm hoping for. Nothing, I guess. I just 
go day by day, and I try not to look ahead. At first, I hoped that somebody 
would save us. I thought maybe it would be Hank Rearden. But he gave in. I 
don't know what they did to him to make him sign, but I know that it must 
have been something terrible. Everybody thinks so. Everybody's whispering 
about it, wondering what sort of pressure was used on him. . . . No, nobody 
knows. He's made no public statements and he's refused to see anyone, . . . 
But, listen, I'll tell you something else that everybody's whispering about. 
Lean closer, will you?— I don't want to speak too loudly. They say that Orren 
Boyle seems to have known about that directive long ago, weeks or months in 
advance, because he had started, quietly and secretly, to reconstruct his 
furnaces for the production of Rearden Metal, in one of his lesser steel 
plants, an obscure little place way out on the coast of Maine, He was ready 
to start pouring the Metal the moment Rearden ' s extortion paper— I mean, Gift 
Certificate— was signed. But— listen— the night before they were to start, 
Boyle's men were heating the furnaces in that place on the coast, when they 
heard a voice, they didn't know whether it came from a plane or a radio or 
some sort of loud-speaker, but it was a man's voice and it said that he would 
give them ten minutes to get out of the place. 

They got out. They started going and they kept on going— because the man's 
voice had said that he was Ragnar Danneskjold. In the next half-hour, Boyle's 
mills were razed to the ground. Razed, wiped out, not a brick of them left 
standing. They say it was done by long-range naval guns, from somewhere way 
out on the Atlantic. Nobody saw Danneskj old ' s ship. . . . That's what people 
are whispering. The newspapers haven't printed a word about it. The boys in 
Washington say that it's only a rumor spread by panic-mongers. ... I don't 
know whether the story is true. I think it is. I hope it is. . . . You know, 
when I was fifteen years old, I used to wonder how any man could become a 
criminal, I couldn't understand what would make it possible. 

Now— now I'm glad that Ragnar Danneskjold has blown up those mills. May God 
bless him and never let them find him, whatever and wherever he is! . . . 
Yes, that's what I've come to feel. Well, how much do they think people can 
take? . . . It's not so bad for me in the daytime, because I can keep busy 
and not think, but it gets me at night. I can't sleep any more, I lie awake 
for hours. . . . Yes!— if you want to know it— yes, it's because I'm worried 
about her! I'm scared to death for her. Woodstock is just a miserable little 
hole of a place, miles away from everything, and the Taggart lodge is twenty 
miles farther, twenty miles of a twisting trail in a godforsaken forest. How 
do I know what might happen to her there, alone, and with the kind of gangs 
that are roving all through the country these nights— just through such 
desolate parts of the country as the Berkshires? ... I know I shouldn't 
think about it. I know that she can take care of herself. Only I wish she'd 
drop me a line. I wish I could go there. But she told me not to. 

I told her I'd wait. . . . You know, I'm glad you're here tonight. It 
helps me— talking to you and . . . just seeing you here. You won't vanish, 
like all the others, will you? . . . What? Next week? . . . Oh, on your 
vacation. For how long? . . . How do you rate a whole month's vacation? . . . 
I wish I could do that, too— take a month off at my own expense. But they 



wouldn't let me. . . . Really? I envy you. ... I wouldn't have envied you a 
few years ago. But now— now I'd like to get away. Now I envy you— if you've 
been able to take a month off every summer for twelve years." 

It was a dark road, but it led in a new direction. Rearden walked from his 
mills, not toward his house, but toward the city of Philadelphia. 

It was a great distance to walk, but he had wanted to do it tonight, as he 
had done it every evening of the past week. He felt at peace in the empty 
darkness of the countryside, with nothing but the black shapes of trees 
around him, with no motion but that of his own body and of branches stirring 
in the wind, with no lights but the slow sparks of the fireflies flickering 
through the hedges. The two hours between mills and city were his span of 
rest . 

He had moved out of his home to an apartment in Philadelphia. He had given 
no explanation to his mother and Philip, he had said nothing except that they 
could remain in the house if they wished and that Miss Ives would take care 
of their bills. He had asked them to tell Lillian, when she returned, that 
she was not to attempt to see him. 

They had stared at him in terrified silence. 

He had handed to his attorney a signed blank check and said, "Get me a 
divorce. On any grounds and at any cost. I don't care what means you use, how 
many of their judges you purchase or whether you find it necessary to stage a 
frame-up of my wife. Do whatever you wish. 

But there is to be no alimony and no property settlement." The attorney 
had looked at him with the hint of a wise, sad smile, as if this were an 
event he had expected to happen long ago. He had answered, "Okay, Hank. It 
can be done. But it will take some time." "Make it as fast as you can." 

No one had questioned him about his signature on the Gift Certificate. But 
he had noticed that the men at the mills looked at him with a kind of 
searching curiosity, almost as if they expected to find the scars of some 
physical torture on his body. 

He felt nothing— nothing but the sense of an even, restful twilight, like a 
spread of slag over a molten metal, when it crusts and swallows the last 
brilliant spurt of the white glow within. He felt nothing at the thought of 
the looters who were now going to manufacture Rearden Metal. His desire to 
hold his right to it and proudly to be the only one to sell it, had been his 
form of respect for his fellow men, his belief that to trade with them was an 
act of honor. The belief, the respect and the desire were gone. He did not 
care what men made, what they sold, where they bought his Metal or whether 
any of them would know that it had been his. The human shapes moving past him 
in the streets of the city were physical objects without any meaning. The 
countryside —with the darkness washing away all traces of human activity, 
leaving only an untouched earth which he had once been able to handle— was 
real . 

He carried a gun in his pocket, as advised by the policemen of the radio 
car that patrolled the roads; they had warned him that no road was safe after 
dark, these days. He felt, with a touch of mirthless amusement, that the gun 
had been needed at the mills, not in the peaceful safety of loneliness and 
night; what could some starving vagrant take from him, compared to what had 
been taken by men who claimed to be his protectors? 

He walked with an effortless speed, feeling relaxed by a form of activity 
that was natural to him. This was his period of training for solitude, he 
thought; he had to learn to live without any awareness of people, the 
awareness that now paralyzed him with revulsion. He had once built his 
fortune, starting out with empty hands; now he had to rebuild his life, 
starting out with an empty spirit. 

He would give himself a short span of time for the training, he thought, 
and then he would claim the one incomparable value still left to him, the one 



desire that had remained pure and whole: he would go to Dagny. Two 
commandments had grown in his mind; one was a duty, the other a passionate 
wish. The first was never to let her learn the reason of his surrender to the 
looters; the second was to say to her the words which he should have known at 
their first meeting and should have said on the gallery of Ellis Wyatt ' s 
house . 

There was nothing but the strong summer starlight to guide him, as he 
walked, but he could distinguish the highway and the remnant of a stone fence 
ahead, at the corner of a country crossroad. The fence had nothing to protect 
any longer, only a spread of weeds, a willow tree bending over the road and, 
farther in the distance, the ruin of a farmhouse with the starlight showing 
through its roof. 

He walked, thinking that even this sight still retained the power to be of 
value: it gave him the promise of a long stretch of space undisturbed by 
human intrusion. 

The man who stepped suddenly out into the road must have come from behind 
the willow tree, but so swiftly that it seemed as if he had sprung up from 
the middle of the highway. Rearden's hand went to the gun in his pocket, but 
stopped: he knew— by the proud posture of the body standing in the open, by 
the straight line of the shoulders against the starlit sky— that the man was 
not a bandit. When he heard the voice, he knew that the man was not a beggar. 

"I should like to speak to you, Mr. Rearden." 

The voice had the firmness, the clarity and the special courtesy peculiar 
to men who are accustomed to giving orders. 

"Go ahead," said Rearden, "provided you don't intend to ask me for help or 
money . " 

The man's garments were rough, but efficiently trim. He wore dark trousers 
and a dark blue windbreaker closed tight at his throat, prolonging the lines 
of his long, slender figure. He wore a dark blue cap, and all that could be 
seen of him in the night were his hands, his face and a patch of gold-blond 
hair on his temple. The hands held no weapon, only a package wrapped in 
burlap, the size of a carton of cigarettes. 

"No, Mr. Rearden," he said, "I don't intend to ask you for money, but to 
return it to you." 

"To return money?" 

"Yes." 

"What money?" 

"A small refund on a very large debt." 
"Owed by you?" 

"No, not by me. It is only a token payment, but I want you to accept it as 
proof that if we live long enough, you and I, every dollar of that debt will 
be returned to you." 

"What debt?" 

"The money that was taken from you by force." 

He extended the package to Rearden, flipping the burlap open. 
Rearden saw the starlight run like fire along a mirror-smooth surface. 
He knew, by its weight and texture, that what he held was a bar of solid 
gold . 

He looked from the bar to the man's face, but the face seemed harder and 
less revealing than the surface of the metal. 
"Who are you?" asked Rearden. 
"The friend of the friendless." 
"Did you come here to give this to me?" 
"Yes." 

"Do you mean that you had to stalk me at night, on a lonely road, in 
order, not to rob me, but to hand me a bar of gold?" 
"Yes . " 



"Why?" 

"When robbery is done in open daylight by sanction of the law, as it is 
done today, then any act of honor or restitution has to be hidden 
underground . " 

"What made you think that I'd accept a gift of this kind?" 

"It is not a gift, Mr. Rearden. It is your own money. But I have one favor 
to ask of you. It is a request, not a condition, because there can be no such 
thing as conditional property. The gold is yours, so you are free to use it 
as you please. But I risked my life to bring it to you tonight, so I am 
asking, as a favor, that you save it for the future or spend it on yourself. 
On nothing but your own comfort and pleasure. Do not give it away and, above 
all, do not put it into your business." 

"Why?" 

"Because I don't want it to be of any benefit to anybody but you. 
Otherwise, I will have broken an oath taken long ago— as I am breaking 
every rule I had set for myself by speaking to you tonight." 
"What do you mean?" 

"I have been collecting this money for you for a long time. But I did not 
intend to see you or tell you about it or give it to you until much later." 
"Then why did you?" 

"Because I couldn't stand it any longer." 
"Stand what?" 

"I thought that I had seen everything one could see and that there was 
nothing I could not stand seeing. But when they took Rearden Metal away from 
you, it was too much, even for me. I know that you don't need this gold at 
present. What you need is the justice which it represents, and the knowledge 
that there are men who care for justice." 

Struggling not to give in to an emotion which he felt rising through his 
bewilderment, past all his doubts, Rearden tried to study the man's face, 
searching for some clue to help him understand. But the face had no 
expression; it had not changed once while speaking; it looked as if the man 
had lost the capacity to feel long ago, and what remained of him were only 
features that seemed implacable and dead. With a shudder of astonishment, 
Rearden found himself thinking that it was not the face of a man, but of an 
avenging angel. 

"Why did you care?" asked Rearden. "What do I mean to you?" 

"Much more than you have reason to suspect. And I have a friend to whom 
you mean much more than you will ever learn. He would have given anything to 
stand by you today. But he can't come to you. So I came in his place." 

"What friend?" 

"I prefer not to name him." 

"Did you say that you've spent a long time collecting this money for me?" 

"I have collected much more than this." He pointed at the gold. "I am 
holding it in your name and I will turn it over to you when the time comes. 
This is only a sample, as proof that it does exist. And if you reach the day 
when you find yourself robbed of the last of your fortune, I want you to 
remember that you have a large bank account waiting for you." 

"What account?" 

"If you try to think of all the money that has been taken from you by 
force, you will know that your account represents a considerable sum." 
"How did you collect it? Where did this gold come from?" 
"It was taken from those who robbed you." 
"Taken by whom?" 
"By me . " 
"Who are you?" 
"Ragnar Danneskj old . " 



Rearden looked at him for a long, still moment, then let the gold fall out 
of his hands. 

Danneskj old ' s eyes did not follow it to the ground, but remained fixed on 
Rearden with no change of expression. "Would you rather I were a law-abiding 
citizen, Mr. Rearden? If so, which law should I abide by? Directive 10-289?" 

"Ragnar Danneskjold . . ." said Rearden, as if he were seeing the whole of 
the past decade, as if he were looking at the enormity of a crime spread 
through ten years and held within two words. 

"Look more carefully, Mr. Rearden. There are only two modes of living left 
to us today: to be a looter who robs disarmed victims or to be a victim who 
works for the benefit of his own despoilers. I did not choose to be either." 

"You chose to live by means of force, like the rest of them, " 

"Yes— openly. Honestly, if you will. I do not rob men who are tied and 
gagged, I do not demand that my victims help me, I do not tell them that I am 
acting for their own good. I stake my life in every encounter with men, and 
they have a chance to match their guns and their brains against mine in fair 
battle. Fair? It's I against the organized strength, the guns, the planes, 
the battleships of five continents. If it's a moral judgment that you wish to 
pronounce, Mr. Rearden, then who is the man of higher morality: I or Wesley 
Mouch?" 

"I have no answer to give you," said Rearden, his voice low. 

"Why should you be shocked, Mr. Rearden? I am merely complying with the 
system which my fellow men have established. If they believe that force is 
the proper means to deal with one another, I am giving them what they ask 
for. If they believe that the purpose of my life is to serve them, let them 
try to enforce their creed. If they believe that my mind is their property- 
let them come and get it." 

"But what sort of life have you chosen? To what purpose are you giving 
your mind?" 

"To the cause of my love." 

"Which is what?" 

"Justice . " 

"Served by being a pirate?" 

"By working for the day when I won't have to be a pirate any longer." 
"Which day is that?" 

"The day when you'll be free to make a profit on Rearden Metal." 
"Oh God!" said Rearden, laughing, his voice desperate. "Is that your 
ambition? " 

Danneskj old ' s face did not change. "It is." 
"Do you expect to live to see that day?" 
"Yes. Don't you?" 
"No . " 

"Then what are you looking forward to, Mr. Rearden?" 
"Nothing. " 

"What are you working for?" 

Rearden glanced at him. "Why do you ask that?" 

"To make you understand why I'm not." 

"Don't expect me ever to approve of a criminal." 

"I don't expect it. But there are a few things I want to help you to see." 

"Even if they're true, the things you said, why did you choose to be a 
bandit? Why didn't you simply step out, like—" He stopped. 

"Like Ellis Wyatt, Mr. Rearden? Like Andrew Stockton? Like your friend Ken 
Danagger ? " 

"Yes ! " 

"Would you approve of that?" 

"I—" He stopped, shocked by his own words. 



The shock that came next was to see Danneskj old smile: it was like seeing 
the first green of spring on the sculptured planes of an iceberg. Rearden 
realized suddenly, for the first time, that Danneskj old ' s face was more than 
handsome, that it had the startling beauty of physical perfection— the hard, 
proud features, the scornful mouth of a Viking's statue— yet he had not been 
aware of it, almost as if the dead sternness of the face had forbidden the 
impertinence of an appraisal. 

But the smile was brilliantly alive. 

"I do approve of it, Mr. Rearden. But I've chosen a special mission of my 
own. I'm after a man whom I want to destroy. He died many centuries ago, but 
until the last trace of him is wiped out of men's minds, we will not have a 
decent world to live in." 

"What man?" 

"Robin Hood." 

Rearden looked at him blankly, not understanding. 

"He was the man who robbed the rich and gave to the poor. Well, I'm the 
man who robs the poor and gives to the rich— or, to be exact, the man who robs 
the thieving poor and gives back to the productive rich." 

"What in blazes do you mean?" 

"If you remember the stories you've read about me in the newspapers, 
before they stopped printing them, you know that I have never robbed a 
private ship and never taken any private property. Nor have I ever robbed a 
military vessel— because the purpose of a military fleet is to protect from 
violence the citizens who paid for it, which is the proper function of a 
government. But I have seized every loot carrier that came within range of my 
guns, every government relief ship, subsidy ship, loan ship, gift ship, every 
vessel with a cargo of goods taken by force from some men for the unpaid, 
unearned benefit of others. I seized the boats that sailed under the flag of 
the idea which I am fighting: the idea that need is a sacred idol requiring 
human sacrifices— that the need of some men is the knife of a guillotine 
hanging over others— that all of us must live with our work, our hopes, our 
plans, our efforts at the mercy of the moment when that knife will descend 
upon us— and that the extent of our ability is the extent of our danger, so 
that success will bring our heads down on the block, while failure will give 
us the right to pull the cord. This is the horror which Robin Hood 
immortalized as an ideal of righteousness. It is said that he fought against 
the looting rulers and returned the loot to those who had been robbed, but 
that is not the meaning of the legend which has survived. He is remembered, 
not as a champion of property, but as a champion of need, not as a defender 
of the robbed, but as a provider of the poor. He is held to be the first man 
who assumed a halo of virtue by practicing charity with wealth which he did 
not own, by giving away goods which he had not produced, by making others pay 
for the luxury of his pity. He is the man who became the symbol of the idea 
that need, not achievement, is the source of rights, that we don't have to 
produce, only to want, that the earned does not belong to us, but the 
unearned does. He became a justification for every mediocrity who, unable to 
make his own living, has demanded the power to dispose of the property of his 
betters, by proclaiming his willingness to devote his life to his inferiors 
at the price of robbing his superiors. It is this foulest of creatures— the 
double-parasite who lives on the sores, of the poor and the blood of the 
rich— whom men have come to regard as a moral ideal. And this has brought us 
to a world where the more a man produces, the closer he comes to the loss of 
all his rights, until, if his ability is great enough, he becomes a rightless 
creature delivered as prey to any claimant— while in order to be placed above 
rights, above principles, above morality, placed where anything is permitted 
to him, even plunder and murder, all a man has to do is to be in need. Do you 
wonder why the world is collapsing around us? That is what I am fighting, Mr. 



Rearden. Until men learn that of all human symbols, Robin Hood is the most 
immoral and the most contemptible, there will be no justice on earth and no 
way for mankind to survive." 

Rearden listened, feeling numb. But under the numbness, like the first 
thrust of a seed breaking through, he felt an emotion he could not identify 
except that it seemed familiar and very distant, like something experienced 
and renounced long ago. 

"What I actually am, Mr. Rearden, is a policeman. It is a policeman's duty 
to protect men from criminals— criminals being those who seize wealth by 
force. It is a policeman's duty to retrieve stolen property and return it to 
its owners. But when robbery becomes the purpose of the law, and the 
policeman's duty becomes, not the protection, but the plunder of property- 
then it is an outlaw who has to become a policeman. I have been selling the 
cargoes I retrieved to some special customers of mine in this country, who 
pay me in gold. Also, I have been selling my cargoes to the smugglers and the 
black-market traders of the People's States of Europe. Do you know the 
conditions of existence in those People's States? Since production and trade— 
not violence— were decreed to be crimes, the best men of Europe had no choice 
but to become criminals. The slave-drivers of those States are kept in power 
by the handouts from their fellow looters in countries not yet fully drained, 
such as this country. I do not let the handouts reach them. I sell the goods 
to Europe's law-breakers, at the highest prices I can get, and I make them 
pay me in gold. Gold is the objective value, the means of preserving one's 
wealth and one's future. Nobody is permitted to have gold in Europe, except 
the whip-wielding friends of humanity, who claim that they spend it for the 
welfare of their victims. That is the gold which my smuggler-customers obtain 
to pay me. 

How? By the same method I use to obtain the goods. And then I return the 
gold to those from whom the goods were stolen— to you, Mr. 
Rearden, and to other men like you." 

Rearden grasped the nature of the emotion he had forgotten. It was the 
emotion he had felt when, at the age of fourteen, he had looked at his first 
pay check— when, at the age of twenty-four, he had been made superintendent of 
the ore mines— when, as the owner of the mines, he had placed, in his own 
name, his first order for new equipment from the best concern of the time, 
Twentieth Century Motors— 

an emotion of solemn, joyous excitement, the sense of winning his place in 
a world he respected and earning the recognition of men he admired. For 
almost two decades, that emotion had been buried under a mount of wreckage, 
as the years had added layer upon gray layer of contempt, of indignation, of 
his struggle not to look around him, not to see those he dealt with, not to 
expect anything from men and to keep, as a private vision within the four 
walls of his office, the sense of that world into which he had hoped to rise. 
Yet there it was again, breaking through from under the wreckage, that 
feeling of quickened interest, of listening to the luminous voice of reason, 
with which one could communicate and deal and live. But it was the voice of a 
pirate speaking about acts of violence, offering him this substitute for his 
world of reason and justice. He could not accept it; he could not lose 
whatever remnant of his vision he still retained. He listened, wishing he 
could escape, yet knowing that he would not miss a word of it. 

"I deposit the gold in a bank— in a gold-standard bank, Mr. Rearden —to the 
account of men who are its rightful owners. They are the men of superlative 
ability who made their fortunes by personal effort, in free trade, using no 
compulsion, no help from the government. They are the great victims who have 
contributed the most and suffered the worst injustice in return. Their names 
are written in my book of restitution. Every load of gold which I bring back 
is divided among them and deposited to their accounts." 



"Who are they?" 

"You're one of them, Mr. Rearden. I cannot compute all the money that has 
been extorted from you— in hidden taxes, in regulations, in wasted time, in 
lost effort, in energy spent to overcome artificial obstacles. I cannot 
compute the sum, but if you wish to see its magnitude —look around you. The 
extent of the misery now spreading through this once prosperous country is 
the extent of the injustice which you have suffered. If men refuse to pay the 
debt they owe you, this is the manner in which they will pay for it. But 
there is one part of the debt which is computed and on record. That is the 
part which I have made it my purpose to collect and return to you." 

"What is that?" 

"Your income tax, Mr. Rearden." 
"What?" 

"Your income tax for the last twelve years." 

"You intend to refund that?" 

"In full and in gold, Mr. Rearden." 

Rearden burst out laughing; he laughed like a young boy, in simple 
amusement, in enjoyment of the incredible. "Good God! You're a policeman and 
a collector of Internal Revenue, too?" 

"Yes," said Danneskjold gravely. 

"You're not serious about this, are you?" 

"Do I look as if I'm joking?" 

"But this is preposterous!" 

"Any more preposterous than Directive 10-289?" 

"It's not real or possible!" 

"Is only evil real and possible?" 

"But-" 

"Are you thinking that death and taxes are our only certainty, Mr. 

Rearden? Well, there's nothing I can do about the first, but if I lift the 
burden of the second, men might learn to see the connection between the two 
and what a longer, happier life they have the power to achieve. They might 
learn to hold, not death and taxes, but life and production as their two 
absolutes and as the base of their moral code." 

Rearden looked at him, not smiling. The tall, slim figure, with the 
windbreaker stressing its trained muscular agility, was that of a highwayman; 
the stern marble face was that of a judge; the dry, clear voice was that of 
an efficient bookkeeper. 

"The looters are not the only ones who have kept records on you, Mr. 
Rearden. So have I. I have, in my files, copies of all your income tax 
returns for the last twelve years, as well as the returns of all my other 
clients. I have friends in some astonishing places, who obtain the copies I 
need. I divide the money among my clients in proportion to the sums extorted 
from them. Most of my accounts have now been paid to their owners. Yours is 
the largest one left to settle. On the day when you will be ready to claim 
it— the day when I'll know that no penny of it will go back to support the 
looters— I will turn your account over to you. Until then—" He glanced down at 
the gold on the ground. "Pick it up, Mr. Rearden. It's not stolen. It's 
yours . " 

Rearden would not move or answer or look down. 

"Much more than that lies in the bank, in your name." 

"What bank?" 

"Do you remember Midas Mulligan of Chicago?" 
"Yes, of course." 

"All my accounts are deposited at the Mulligan Bank." 
"There is no Mulligan Bank in Chicago." 
"It is not in Chicago." 

Rearden let a moment pass. "Where is it?" 



"I think that you will know it before long, Mr. Rearden. But I cannot tell 
you now." He added, "I must tell you, however, that I am the only one 
responsible for this undertaking. It is my own personal mission. No one is 
involved in it but me and the men of my ship's crew. 

Even my banker has no part in it, except for keeping the money I deposit. 
Many of my friends do not approve of the course I've chosen. 

But we all choose different ways to fight the same battle— and this is 
mine . " 

Rearden smiled contemptuously, "Aren't you one of those damn altruists who 
spends his time on a non-profit venture and risks his life merely to serve 
others?" 

"No, Mr. Rearden. I am investing my time in my own future. 

When we are free and have to start rebuilding from out of the ruins, I 
want to see the world reborn as fast as possible. If there is, then, some 
working capital in the right hands— in the hands of our best, our most 
productive men— it will save years for the rest of us and, incidentally, 
centuries for the history of the country. Did you ask what you meant to me? 
Everything I admire, everything I want to be on the day when the earth will 
have a place for such state of being, everything I want to deal with— even if 
this is the only way I can deal with you and be of use to you at present." 

"Why?" whispered Rearden. 

"Because my only love, the only value I care to live for, is that which 
has never been loved by the world, has never won recognition or friends or 
defenders: human ability. That is the love I am serving— and if I should lose 
my life, to what better purpose could I give it?" 

The man who had lost the capacity to feel ?— thought Rearden, and knew that 
the austerity of the marble face was the form of a disciplined capacity to 
feel too deeply. The even voice was continuing dispassionately: "I wanted you 
to know this. I wanted you to know it now, when it most seem to you that 
you're abandoned at the bottom of a pit among subhuman creatures who are all 
that's left of mankind. I wanted you to know, in your most hopeless hour, 
that the day of deliverance is much closer than you think. And there was one 
special reason why I had to speak to you and tell you my secret ahead of the 
proper time. 

Have you heard of what happened to Orren Boyle's steel mills on the coast 
of Maine?" 

"Yes," said Rearden— and was shocked to hear that the word came as a gasp 
out of the sudden jolt of eagerness within him. "I didn't know whether it was 
true . " 

"It's true. I did it. Mr. Boyle is not going to manufacture Rearden Metal 
on the coast of Maine. He is not going to manufacture it anywhere. Neither is 
any other looting louse who thinks that a directive can give him a right to 
your brain. Whoever attempts to produce that Metal, will find his furnaces 
blown up, his machinery blasted, his shipments wrecked, his plant set on 
fire— so many things will happen to any man who tries it, that people will say 
there's a curse on it, and there will soon be no worker in the country 
willing to enter the plant of any new producer of Rearden Metal. If men like 
Boyle think that force is all they need to rob their betters— let them see 
what happens when one of their betters chooses to resort to force. I wanted 
you to know, Mr. Rearden, that none of them will produce your Metal nor make 
a penny on it . " 

Because he felt an exultant desire to laugh— as he had laughed at the news 
of Wyatt ' s fire, as he had laughed at the crash of d'Anconia Copper— and knew 
that if he did, the thing he feared would hold him, would not release him 
this time, and he would never see his mills again— Rearden drew back and, for 
a moment, kept his lips closed tight to utter no sound. When the moment was 



over, he said quietly, his voice firm and dead, "Take that gold of yours and 
get away from here. I won't accept the help of a criminal." 

Danneskj old ' s face showed no reaction. "I cannot force you to accept the 
gold, Mr. Rearden. But I will not take it back. You may leave it lying where 
it is, if you wish." 

"I don't want your help and I don't intend to protect you. If I were 
within reach of a phone, I would call the police. I would and I will, if you 
ever attempt to approach me again. I'll do it— in self-protection." 

"I understand exactly what you mean." 

"You know— because I've listened to you, because you've seen me eager to 
hear it— that I haven't damned you as I should. I can't damn you or anyone 
else. There are no standards left for men to live by, so I don't care to 
judge anything they do today or in what manner they attempt to endure the 
unendurable. If this is your manner, I will let you go to hell in your own 
way, but I want no part of it. Neither as your inspiration nor as your 
accomplice. Don't expect me ever to accept your bank account, if it does 
exist. Spend it on some extra armor plate for yourself— because I'm going to 
report this to the police and give them every clue I can to set them on your 
trail." 

Danneskjold did not move or answer. A freight train was rolling by, 
somewhere in the distance and darkness; they could not see it, but they heard 
the pounding beat of wheels filling the silence, and it seemed close, as if a 
disembodied train, reduced to a long string of sound, were going past them in 
the night. 

"You wanted to help me in my most hopeless hour?" said Rearden. 

"If I am brought to where my only defender is a pirate, then I don't care 
to be defended any longer. You speak some remnant of a human language, so in 
the name of that, I'll tell you that I have no hope left, but I have the 
knowledge that when the end comes, I will have lived by my own standards, 
even while I was the only one to whom they remained valid. I will have lived 
in the world in which I started and J will go down with the last of it. I 
don't think you'll want to understand me, but—" 

A beam of light hit them with the violence of a physical blow. The clangor 
of the train had swallowed the noise of the motor and they had not heard the 
approach of the car that swept out of the side road, from behind the 
farmhouse. They were not in the car's path, yet they heard the screech of 
brakes behind the two headlights, pulling an invisible shape to a stop. It 
was Rearden who jumped back involuntarily and had time to marvel at his 
companion: the swiftness of Danneskj old ' s self-control was that he did not 
move . 

It was a police car and it stopped beside them. 

The driver leaned out. "Oh, it's you, Mr. Rearden!" he said, touching his 
fingers to his cap. "Good evening, sir." 

"Hello, " said Rearden, fighting to control the unnatural abruptness of his 
voice . 

There were two patrolmen in the front seat of the car and their faces had 
a tight look of purpose, not the look of their usual friendly intention to 
stop for a chat. 

"Mr. Rearden, did you walk from the mills by way of Edgewood Road, past 
Blacksmith Cove?" 
"Yes. Why?" 

"Did you happen to see a man anywhere around these parts, a stranger 
moving along in a hurry?" 
"Where?" 

"He'd be either on foot or in a battered wreck of a car that's got a 
million-dollar motor." 
"What man?" 



"A tall man with blond hair." 
"Who is he?" 

"You wouldn't believe it if I told you, Mr. Rearden. Did you see him?" 

Rearden was not aware of his own questions, only of the astonishing fact 
that he was able to force sounds past some beating barrier inside his throat. 
He was looking straight at the policeman, but he felt as if the focus of his 
eyes had switched to his side vision, and what he saw most clearly was 
Danneskj old ' s face watching him with no expression, with no line's, no 
muscle's worth of feeling. He saw Danneskj old ' s arms hanging idly by his 
sides, the hands relaxed, with no sign of intention to reach for a weapon, 
leaving the tall, straight body defenseless and open— open as to a firing 
squad. He saw, in the light, that the face looked younger than he had thought 
and that the eyes were sky-blue. 

He felt that his one danger would be to glance directly at Danneskj old— and 
he kept his eyes on the policeman, on the brass buttons of a blue uniform, 
but the object filling his consciousness, more forcefully than a visual 
perception, was Danneskj old ' s body, the naked body under the clothes, the 
body that would be wiped out of existence. He did not hear his own words, 
because he kept hearing a single sentence in his mind, without context except 
the feeling that it was the only thing that mattered to him in the world: "If 
I should lose my life, to what better purpose could I give it?" 

"Did you see him, Mr. Rearden?" 

"No," said Rearden. "I didn't." 

The policeman shrugged regretfully and closed his hands about the steering 
wheel. "You didn't see any man that looked suspicious?" 
"No . " 

"Nor any strange car passing you on the road?" 
"No . " 

The policeman reached for the starter. "They got word that he was seen 
ashore in these parts tonight, and they've thrown a dragnet over five 
counties. We're not supposed to mention his name, not to scare the folks, but 
he's a man whose head is worth three million dollars in rewards from all over 
the world . " 

He had pressed the starter and the motor was churning the air with bright 
cracks of sound, when the second policeman leaned forward. 

He had been looking at the blond hair under Danneskj old ' s cap. 
"Who is that, Mr. Rearden?" he asked. 
"My new bodyguard," said Rearden. 

"Oh . . . ! A sensible precaution, Mr. Rearden, in times like these. 
Good night, sir." 

The motor jerked forward. The red taillights of the car went shrinking 
down the road. Danneskjold watched it go, then glanced pointedly at Rearden' s 
right hand. Rearden realized that he had stood facing the policemen with his 
hand clutching the gun in his pocket and that he had been prepared to use it. 

He opened his fingers and drew his hand out hastily. Danneskjold smiled. 
It was a smile of radiant amusement, the silent laughter of a clear, young 
spirit greeting a moment it was glad to have lived. 

And although the two did not resemble each other, the smile made Rearden 
think of Francisco d'Anconia. 

"You haven't told a lie," said Ragnar Danneskjold. "Your bodyguard— that ' s 
what I am and what I'll deserve to be, in many more ways than you can know at 
present. Thanks, Mr. Rearden, and so long— we'll meet again much sooner than I 
had hoped." 

He was gone before Rearden could answer. He vanished beyond the stone 
fence, as abruptly and soundlessly as he had come. When Rearden turned to 
look through the farm field, there was no trace of him and no sign of 
movement anywhere in the darkness. 



Rearden stood on the edge of an empty road in a spread of loneliness 
vaster than it had seemed before. Then he saw, lying at his feet, an object 
wrapped in burlap, with one corner exposed and glistening in the moonlight, 
the color of the pirate's hair. He bent, picked it up and walked on. 

Kip Chalmers swore as the train lurched and spilled his cocktail over the 
table top. He slumped forward, his elbow in the puddle, and said: "God damn 
these railroads! What's the matter with their track? 

You'd think with all the money they've got they'd disgorge a little, so we 
wouldn't have to bump like farmers on a hay cart!" 

His three companions did not take the trouble to answer. It was late, and 
they remained in the lounge merely because an effort was needed to retire to 
their compartments. The lights of the lounge looked like feeble portholes in 
a fog of cigarette smoke dank with the odor of alcohol. It was a private car, 
which Chalmers had demanded and obtained for his journey; it was attached to 
the end of the Comet and it swung like the tail of a nervous animal as the 
Comet coiled through the curves of the mountains. 

"I'm going to campaign for the nationalization of the railroads," 

said Kip Chalmers, glaring defiantly at a small, gray man who looked at 
him without interest. 'That's going to be my platform plank. I've got to have 
a platform plank. I don't like Jim Taggart. He looks like a soft-boiled clam. 
To hell with the railroads! It's time we took them over." 

"Go to bed, " said the man, "if you expect to look like anything human at 
the big rally tomorrow." 

"Do you think we'll make it?" 

"You've got to make it." 

"I know I've got to. But I don't think we'll get there on time. This 
goddamn snail of a super-special is hours late." 

"You've got to get there, Kip," said the man ominously, in that stubborn 
monotone of the unthinking which asserts an end without concern for the 
means . 

"God damn you, don't you suppose I know it?" 

Kip Chalmers had curly blond hair and a shapeless mouth. He came from a 
semi-wealthy, semi-distinguished family, but he sneered at wealth and 
distinction in a manner which implied that only a top rank aristocrat could 
permit himself such a degree of cynical indifference. He had graduated from a 
college which specialized in breeding that kind of aristocracy. The college 
had taught him that the purpose of ideas is to fool those who are stupid 
enough to think. He had made his way in Washington with the grace of a cat- 
burglar, climbing from bureau to bureau as from ledge to ledge of a crumbling 
structure. He was ranked as semi-powerful, but his manner made laymen mistake 
him for nothing less than Wesley Mouch. 

For reasons of his own particular strategy, Kip Chalmers had decided to 
enter popular politics and to run for election as Legislator from California, 
though he knew nothing about that state except the movie industry and the 
beach clubs. His campaign manager had done the preliminary work, and Chalmers 
was now on his way to face his future constituents for the first time at an 
over publicized rally in San Francisco tomorrow night. The manager had wanted 
him to start a day earlier, but Charmers had stayed in Washington to attend a 
cocktail party and had taken the last train possible. He had shown no concern 
about the rally until this evening, when he noticed that the Comet was 
running six hours late. 

His three companions did not mind his mood: they liked his liquor, tester 
Tuck, his campaign manager, was a small, aging man with a face that looked as 
if it had once been punched in and had never rebounded. He was an attorney 
who, some generations earlier, would have represented shoplifters and people 
who stage accidents on the premises of rich corporations; now he found that 
he could do better by representing men like Kip Chalmers. 



Laura Bradford was Chalmers' current mistress; he liked her because his 
predecessor had been Wesley Mouch. She was a movie actress who had forced her 
way from competent featured player to incompetent star, not by means of 
sleeping with studio executives, but by taking the long-distance short cut of 
sleeping with bureaucrats. She talked economics, instead of glamor, for press 
interviews, in the belligerently righteous style of a third-rate tabloid; her 
economics consisted of the assertion that "we've got to help the poor." 

Gilbert Keith-Worthing was Chalmers' guest, for no reason that either of 
them could discover. He was a British novelist of world fame, who had been 
popular thirty years ago; since then, nobody bothered to read what he wrote, 
but everybody accepted him as a walking classic. 

He had been considered profound for uttering such things as: "Freedom? Do 
let's stop talking about freedom. Freedom is impossible. Man can never be 
free of hunger, of cold, of disease, of physical accidents. 

He can never be free of the tyranny of nature. So why should he object to 
the tyranny of a political dictatorship?" When all of Europe put into 
practice the ideas which he bad preached, he came to live in America. Through 
the years, his style of writing and his body had grown flabby. At seventy, he 
was an obese old man with retouched hair and a manner of scornful cynicism 
retouched by quotations from the yogis about the futility of all human 
endeavor. Kip Chalmers had invited him, because it seemed to look 
distinguished. Gilbert Keith Worthing had come along, because he had no 
particular place to go. 

"God damn these railroad people!" said Kip Chalmers. "They're doing it on 
purpose. They want to ruin my campaign. I can't miss that rally! For Christ's 
sake, Lester, do something!" 

"I've tried," said Lester Tuck. At the train's last stop, he had tried, by 
long-distance telephone, to find air transportation to complete their 
journey; but there were no commercial flights scheduled for the next two 
days . 

"If they don't get me there on time, I'll have their scalps and their 
railroad! Can't we tell that damn conductor to hurry?" 
"You've told him three times," 

"I'll get him fired. He's given me nothing but a lot of alibis about all 
their messy technical troubles. I expect transportation, not alibis. They 
can't treat me like one of their day-coach passengers. I expect them to get 
me where I want to go when I want it. Don't they know that I'm on this 
train?" 

"They know it by now," said Laura Bradford. "Shut up, Kip. You bore me." 

Chalmers refilled his glass. The car was rocking and the glassware tinkled 
faintly on the shelves of the bar. The patches of starlit sky in the windows 
kept swaying jerkily, and it seemed as if the stars were tinkling against one 
another. They could see nothing beyond the glass bay of the observation 
window at the end of the car, except the small halos of red and green 
lanterns marking the rear of the train, and a brief stretch of rail running 
away from them into the darkness. A wall of rock was racing the train, and 
the stars dipped occasionally into a sudden break that outlined, high above 
them, the peaks of the mountains of Colorado. 

"Mountains . . ." said Gilbert Keith-Worthing, with satisfaction. 

"It is a spectacle of this kind that makes one feel the insignificance of 
man.' What is this presumptuous little bit of rail, which crude materialists 
are so proud of building— compared to that eternal grandeur? No more than the 
basting thread of a seamstress on the hem of the garment of nature. If a 
single one of those granite giants chose to crumble, it would annihilate this 
train . "
